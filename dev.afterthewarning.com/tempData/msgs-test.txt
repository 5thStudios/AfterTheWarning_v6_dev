I adore You, praise You and glorify You, my Lord and my God! Thank You for allowing us to be here with You today. Thank You for Holy Mass this morning and Holy Communion. Lord, there are so many who need Your healing, consolations and guidance. Jesus, please be with the young man we met last evening. Help him not to be discouraged. Help him to grow closer to You. Guide him, protect him and teach him all he needs to learn. Bless (names withheld) marriage, Jesus and grant them the desire to have their marriage convalidated in the Church. Give them graces of conversion and deep love for You, the Church and for one another. Bless all who are ill, especially (names withheld) and all who are on the parish prayer list. Lord, bless Your holy priest sons, the Bishops, our Holy Father and all deacons and religious. Guard the sanctity of their vocations and keep them safe in Your Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Please bring home those who are away from the Church, especially (names withheld). Jesus, take care of all our needs. Lord, give our grandchildren the holy longing for You. Set their hearts on fire with the flame of Your pure love. Lord, be with the Church in this dark hour. Raise up many vocations to the priesthood and religious life. Guide, guard and direct the Holy Father. Surround him with holy counsel and give him extraordinary gifts of discernment, wisdom and right-judgement.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I love You, Lord, and I place all my trust in You. All that I am is Yours and all that I have is Yours. I give You my ‘yes’ again today, Lord. Use me as You Will. Lord, I invite You to be present in every meeting I have with others this week. Help me to recognize Your presence in each person. Help me to listen with my heart to all they say and even to what is not said. Pour Your love into my heart and allow it to flow through me to others. Spread Your grace everywhere I go, Jesus. Use my hands and feet to carry You to those I encounter and may each encounter really be a meeting, an encounter with You. St. Padre Pio, pray for me. St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, pray for me. All you holy men and women, all angels in Heaven, pray for me. Pray for my family and my friends and most especially, pray for those people in the world who do not know the love of God. Bring about conversion of the entire world, Jesus through the Immaculate Heart of Mary and renew the face of the earth through Your Holy Spirit. Jesus, I trust in You. Jesus, I trust in You. Jesus, I trust in You. Lord, give each child of ours the gifts of faith, hope and love. The gift of holiness and one day may they all inherit Your Kingdom, Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, My little one, I thank you for coming to adore Me today. I know of your weariness and I bless you both for coming to be with Me in spite of this fatigue you are experiencing. Thank you for choosing the work I have for you over your personal comfort. You are concerned about your encounter with the young man (name withheld) last evening. Do not be concerned. You were not out of line speaking with him, but instead acted on the promptings of My Spirit. My child, he needed the encouragement you gave him. I know you felt uneasy with the words that flowed through you, since you did not know him, but remember, I know him well. These words were what his heart desperately needed. He will hold them in his heart as a source of hope for a long time to come. Pray for him. He needs your prayers. I ask you and (name withheld) to remember him often in your prayers for others. I have a plan for his life, My child and just as you told him, the evil one works to destroy this plan. He is vulnerable, as many young people are. The youth of this day, generally speaking, are not disposed to receiving graces, as they have little knowledge of Me, the Gospel, the beauty of virtue and have not been well formed. Much prayer is needed for the youth of this day, and for young adults who have been raised in this culture devoid of God and My love. Pray, pray, pray. Pray for these beautiful children of God who desperately seek My love and have no idea what it is they are seeking and no clue where to find Me. Pray for holy families, for chaste and pure holy parents who will instruct and form hearts for God and for My Kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, you are concerned for your grandchildren and especially for (name withheld) as you notice he is growing and beginning to exert his independence. It is important for him that (name withheld) and you spend time with him. Be present to him and encourage his gifts. He has many, and you will notice more unfolding in time. Allow him space to make mistakes, but correct him quickly with love and patience. He has a fiery heart, but one such as this requires firmness, mixed with patience and gentleness. I will channel his gifts with My graces so that he will grow into a good man with a heart for God. All will be well. Limit his exposure to worldly things. His mother, My (name withheld) is suffering physical trials. Her crosses are being used for My glory. I love her. She is a beautiful flower and her suffering brings the perfume of My grace to many souls in need of love. Give her My words, My daughter. I am carrying her through this challenging time. I am with her. I am with each child of yours. This time before Me in Adoration is a gift that you give to Me, and I will secure many graces for your family and your loved ones in turn.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Jesus. Praise You, Lord. I believe You because You have said so, Jesus though at times I see no sign of these graces. Still, we do not come here to be with You because of what we need You to do for us, but we come because of our love for You. You deserve to be loved and adored, Lord God. You are beautiful. You are magnificent. You are the Almighty God, King of All Nations, Redeemer, Savior, Creator and Lover of the human race. You are the essence of holiness, purity, righteousness, love and mercy. You are love. You deserve to be loved. Thank You for who You are, Lord. My words are inadequate and fail to describe Your infinite goodness. I love You, Jesus. Thank You for Your love!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“You are welcome, My child. Your attempt to describe what you feel in your heart touches Me and fills Me with joy. I know your heart, My little lamb, and you are growing more intimate with Me and growing in the knowledge of My Sacred Heart, the characteristics of God. My sheep, My friends know My voice and you child, are My friend. You are thinking about the times you have disappointed Me?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Jesus. I am glad You think of Me as Your friend. Indeed, I am honored to be Your friend, but I am not such a good friend to You. Certainly, not as good as many of Your friends and absolutely pitiful in comparison to Your loyalty to me. Help me to be more loyal to You, Jesus. I don’t ever want to disappoint You again, Jesus. Take My many character flaws and transform them through Your grace. Help me, Jesus to be more loving, more even tempered, more patient, more self-giving. Help me to be like Your holy and pure Mother. Give me a heart like Hers, Lord. Blessed Mother, please give me Your heart in place of mine. No heart loves Jesus like Yours, Blessed Mother.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, My little one, I hear your prayer. My Mother hears your prayer. Be patient with yourself, as I am patient with you. I am bringing you along the path to holiness with the utmost care. A soul growing in holiness must be nurtured and watered, have the proper amount of sunshine, warmth and nutrients to put down deep roots. These deep roots firmly support the plant and provide a deeper supply of water and nutrients. Then during the cold, winter months the plant is able to survive. Later, when the good weather returns, the plant grows even stronger. The cycle repeats until the plant can outlast storms, drought conditions, wind, disease and all manner of trials. This only occurs slowly, My child and over time. Such it is with your soul. I patiently prune, fertilize and water your soul, My child. All the while you are becoming more and more firmly rooted in your love for Me and for the Trinity. You see My hand in many ordinary situations now, My little lamb. I give you times of enlightenment and insight even though partially veiled, so that you do not see the complete picture, but sense I am at work. You sense specific times that My plan is beginning to unfold, before there are any tangible signs. This is gifted to you because you are close to Me and those who draw near to My Sacred Heart know the workings of My Heart and can recognize signs of My Divine Will at work. Keep these insights close to your heart. They are My gift to you and though you are still not certain of the outcome I delight in your wonder and awe. It is the same way you felt when your children were young and full of excitement on Christmas Day. You watched with joy, their delight in the many surprises wrapped with love and great attention. You knew what was inside each package, but delighted in their joy and in their anticipation. I too, am delighted when My children have a sense of awe as they watch My plans unfold. I desire to share everything with My children and I willingly share with those who seek My friendship. I share more gifts of the Holy Spirit with those who are well disposed. My Children of Light, I repeat My invitation to frequent the Sacraments, Reconciliation and Holy Communion. Strive for purity of heart. Bring everything to Me, no matter how large or small. I am your All. I am your Jesus. There is nothing I will refuse you when it comes to your growth in holiness. The Sacraments provide the needed graces for your growth in love and holiness. This is the means I choose to use and have made available to you. Do not continue to take these great gifts for granted, but be thankful for them. Avail yourselves of the Sacraments so that you will be firmly planted in rich soil and firmly rooted in My love. Together, we will accomplish the Will of My Father for mankind. I need you, My children. I love you and I choose to use you as My instruments. The Sacraments will give you the necessary graces to love one another, as I love you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My (name withheld), My (name withheld) I love you and I bless you in the name of My Father, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit. Go in My peace. Go in My love. Be joy, be mercy, be love to all you encounter. Bring My light to a world in darkness and in desperation. May all of My children be conduits of love to each person encountered on the road on which you journey to the Eternal Father. In this way, all will come to know Me through My holy Children of Light and love. Then, the renewal you pray for, long for and which will come through My Mother’s Immaculate Heart will come. Pray for this, work for this in love. The work I refer to is the work you cooperate with Me to do and it begins in your own souls through prayer. Therefore, pray My children. Pray”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“This is all, My little lamb. I am with you. I will be with you each day. I love you. I give you My peace. I breathe on you, My son and My daughter. My Spirit is with you now in a more profound way. You will not see this, but that is My Will. All will be well.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Jesus. Praise You, Lord. Amen! Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;"},{"id":9224,"datePublished":"2018-08-26T00:00:00","nodeName":"Recent Msgs to Children of the Renewal","pageTitle":"Recent Messages","subtitle":"","author":"","visionary":"Children of the Renewal","visionaryId":9538,"originalSource":"https://www.childrenoftherenewal.com/childrenoftherenewal","originalSourceName":"Children of the Renewal","lstDateOfMsgs":null,"content":"&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I am not sure who this visionary is, so please pray for descernment before proceeding.

I believe, hope, love and adore You, my God and my King. Thank You for Holy Mass this morning! Thank You for Holy Communion. What an incredible blessing, Lord. Thank You for Your holy priest sons, who bring us the Sacraments. Please bless and protect them as well as the religious who consecrate their lives to You. Keep them safe, especially those who are travelling.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lord, thank You for my meeting with (name withheld). It was so good to see her. Please continue to give her graces of conversion and penitence. Help her to have faith in You, Lord. I pray for all who are away from the Church, Jesus. Bring them home safely (and quickly) according to Your Holy Will. Lord, thank You for the meeting yesterday with (name withheld) and the ladies who attended our breakfast meeting yesterday. It was so good to be able to discuss the retreat we attended. Help the beauty of the retreat to continue to resonate in my heart. Lord, this week will be busy for our family. Help (name withheld) as she begins her externship. Guide and direct her, Lord so that she learns and remembers what she needs for her new profession and enable her to be a beautiful witness to Your love. Help us all in this regard, Lord. Lord, thank You for being with me at work through all of the meetings with people. Please continue to be with me this week, as well. Guide me in what I say and do and may Your presence in me radiate to others in need of Your love and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;(Name and personal petition withheld). Lord, may all that I do and say be for Your honor and glory. Help me, Jesus to be more and more like Your Blessed Mother Mary. Lord, I pray for an increase in vocations to the priesthood and religious life. May families grow in holiness so to bear fruits for Your Kingdom. I pray for (name withheld) and for all Your holy priest sons who do missionary work here in our country. Give them graces to love heroically, the strength to minister to us sheep, and the protection of Your Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. I love You, Jesus. Help me to love You more. I trust You, Jesus. Increase my trust in You. I believe. Increase my faith in You, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Father, thank You for giving us the Feast of God the Father of all Mankind. What a beautiful feast! Help me to prepare during this 8-day novena leading up to Your Feast Day. Help this to be spread all over the earth, Father to give You honor, glory and praise. May this beautiful day honoring the first person of the Trinity help restore fatherhood to mankind so in need of You, God. We love You and trust in You!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, God the Father Wills that all will observe and celebrate this feast in His honor and by doing so will receive many graces as well as healing of fatherhood which is in a crisis at this time in the world. Much healing is needed as a result of absent and unloving fathers to teach, direct, protect and love their families. This has resulted in a crisis of faith, lack of love, diminished number of vocations, rebellious children, a lack of discipline and respect for authority and if allowed to continue will breed violence and unrest in generations to come. When children do not have good fathers (or father figures), they are unable to relate to God the Father. This is why the evil one attacks fatherhood. Observing this feast day will help to heal the vocation of fatherhood, as God is the Father of All Mankind. My children, if you did not have a loving father (earthly) know that your Father in Heaven is a loving, kind, merciful father. He is a good father and He loves you, His children. There is much evil and corruption in the world, My children. This does not come as a surprise to many of you, and yet there are more who do not recognize this. They are somewhat aware, but have become so accustomed to hearing the ‘bad news’ that they are numb to the terrible plight of many of your suffering brothers and sisters. The unholy culture is all around you and robs the innocence of My very young, little ones. This is evil at its core, My children. Parents, shelter your children from evil society that corrupts My holy innocent ones. Protect them from My adversary who wants to steal purity and chastity from My youth. Parents, it is your responsibility to protect your children and grandchildren’s innocence. Shield them. Protect them. They are like little white, innocent lambs, abandoned by their shepherds, their fathers and their mothers. This cannot continue, My children. Your families are the domestic church. Do not allow satan an open invitation into your home and worse, into your children’s hearts through vile entertainment and media. My children—AWAKEN! Open your eyes. Do not simply take the ‘easy’ route, or say that ‘everyone else is doing this.’ Come, My Children of Light, if you do not bear light in your hearts, and your homes, why do you lament the darkness in the world? If you cannot stand against portals of evil into your homes, you will not have a foundation in which to stand against evil that is on your doorstep. No, you will not stand against what is on your doorstep because you have opened the door and invited it into your homes through the television, lewd advertising, profane music and countless other forms of entertainment. My children, oh when will you see what you are allowing to happen to your little ones. Their holy innocence is being stolen and their parents turn a blind eye. There will be severe judgement on you for this. Turn now from your wicked ways and pray for your children. Protect them at all costs. You are responsible for leading their souls to Heaven. Protect My little children. It is your duty. Love them as I have loved you. What have I withheld from you, My children? I sacrificed everything out of love for you. I did not take the easy, comfortable path. I said ‘yes’ to My Father’s Will and I accepted the agony, the suffering, the scourging, the crowning with thorns, the carrying of the cross, bearing the weight of the entire world’s sins including your sins. I accepted the nailing of My flesh and bones to the cross. I accepted a violent death, so that you could one day rise and be with Me in Heaven. I came to heal, to save and to die. I did not take the easy road, but the road to Calvary. You must not take the easy road with your children, but stand up for holiness, purity, chastity and love. Stand up for virtue and love of God. Stand for My Commandments. Stand against materialism, egoism, pride, greed and lust. Go to the Sacrament of Reconciliation and be reconciled to God and My Church. Turn away from sin and be healed. I love you. You are Mine. We can be united again, but you must focus on purity and teach your children purity. Teach them modesty, humility, mercy and love. Do this now before it is too late.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lord, please have mercy on us. Give us the ability to see what needs to be changed in our homes, to put You first, above all things and to truly love one another. Break the curses put upon our society through drugs, evil spirits and a worldly pride. Protect our children, Lord when we are not with them. Keep them safe from all harm. Surround their little souls with holy friends, mentors and loving relatives. Jesus, for those children living without parents, give them a multitude of love and consolation directly from the Holy Trinity and the Blessed Mother. Send holy, loving adult role models to guide them. Heal our broken world, Holy Spirit. Blessed Mother, take our hands and help us find Jesus. Cover our youth with Your holy mantle of protection. Come Holy Spirit and renew the face of the Earth. Jesus, I trust in You. Jesus, I trust in You. Jesus, I trust in You. Thank You for Your love, Your guidance, Your correction, Lord. Praise You for not giving up on us, Father. Praise You for sending Your Son to redeem us. Praise You for allowing Your Holy Mother Mary to visit the earth with her instruction, teaching and motherly love. Prepare us, Jesus for the outpouring of Your Spirit and for the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary who will crush the head of the serpent by the flame of love, which is You, Jesus! Come, Holy Spirit, come! I love You, Lord. Thank You for loving me.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, My child, it is true that I love you. I will be with you during every meeting during times of difficulty and times of joy. Take courage and know that I love you and walk with you. Have no fear, but trust in Me. All will be well. Strengthen your resolve to pray, My child. I will help you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Lord. I love You.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“I remind you of the importance of family prayer, My children. Remember this; it is for your protection as well as your growth in love and holiness. Do not neglect family prayer. I look to you, fathers to be diligent and to lead your family in praying the rosary. Remember that through the prayer of the rosary, miracles happen, war is averted, relationships healed and wayward children return home. Do not underestimate the value of family prayer. Protect your family from vice by praying the rosary and the fertile soil in your hearts will begin to yield fruit for My Kingdom. All will be well, but you must begin, for there is much work to do to turn around this dark culture and reclaim families for God. Nothing is impossible for Me. All is possible with Me. Pray, frequent the Sacraments and read Holy Scripture. I love you, My children. I love you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Praise and thank You, Lord of Lords, King of Kings, Prince of Peace, my Lord and my God!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“Go in peace, My (name withheld) and My (name withheld). All will be well. I love you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I love You, Lord. Praise You, Jesus! Amen! Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;July 22, 2018 Adoration Chapel&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hello, Jesus present in the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar. It is wonderful to be here with You. I love You, my Jesus. Thank You for Holy Mass and Holy Communion this morning. It was beautiful as always. It was so good to see (name withheld). What a joy to see her and to have her ‘home’ again. (Name withheld) and I both thought about my Mother and how much we miss her presence with us. She would have been so pleased (and I’m sure she was) seeing (name withheld) celebrate Mass. (Private dialogue omitted.) It truly was a holy moment. What great joy it was and must have been for all of Heaven. Lord, please take (name withheld) to Heaven to be with You if she isn’t there already. Please help (names withheld) as they grieve the loss of their mother. Console (name withheld), Lord. It is very painful to experience the loss of someone so close to your heart. I can’t imagine how painful the sorrows of the Blessed Mother were when she witnessed Your crucifixion and death. My Jesus, I love You, adore You and praise You, my God and my King. What can I do for You, my Adorable Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“Love Me, My child. Love Me in the Eucharist, My Eucharistic Presence.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Jesus. I love You in Your Eucharistic Presence, Lord. Help me to love You more. Jesus, I believe in You; increase my faith. Jesus, I trust in You. Help me to trust You more. Lord, please draw me close to Your Sacred Heart. Do so for all of my family, Lord. May we all dwell in the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus. May we all be in the School of Our Lady where She teaches us to be like You and to follow You more completely. Lord, please help all mankind to desire Your love and redemption. Help the desire to love You grow even more intense in my soul, Lord God. Holy Spirit, lover of my soul, give me the graces to love heroically, to love the Lord God with my entire being. I am all Yours, Jesus and all that I have is Yours.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, please write My words. These words are for you and also for all of My children. I am God, it is true that I created the world out of nothing, but I am also your friend. I love mankind so much so that I became man to redeem the human race. I did this out of My deep love for My children, whom I created in My image and likeness. Though I am certainly all powerful, all knowing and ever present, I am also your friend. I love mankind so much so, that I lay down My life for My friend. I wish, no I long to be friends with each and every soul created. My love, for love’s sake desires love in return. I thirst for your love, My children. I desire your friendship now and also in Heaven when your earthly pilgrimage ends My children, those who are far from Me, cause Me deep sorrow, for to be far from Me, endangers your soul. Do not be distant from Me, My children, but come to Me. Bring your life’s joys and your life’s sorrows, trials and suffering to Me. Bring your fears, your challenges, your concerns to Me. I am the answer to all of life’s problems. I await your visits to Me in the Adoration Chapels and in every Tabernacle in the world, where I am often left to Myself. I do not abandon you, My children. It is you who abandon Me. Come, visit with Me. When you bring your concerns and burdens to Me, I will help you carry them. I make your burdens light, My children. If your crosses are heavy, that is because you are attempting to carry them without Me. Do you not see that even I needed assistance to carry My heavy cross? It was the plan of God, the Father. Every concern, no matter how small, must be brought to Me. Come, I will guide and direct you. I will give you graces to grow in holiness and love.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Jesus, my Lord. Thank You for Your presence and for making Yourself accessible to Your flock. Jesus, please grant my request for our parish, if it is Your Will. May we have an Adoration Chapel, also. It would help our parishioners to grow in holiness and love, send more vocations to the priesthood and religious life, Jesus. Lord, I pray for all people to return to You, to Your love. Jesus, send Your Holy Spirit to renew the face of the earth. May the Immaculate Heart of Your Holy Mother Mary triumph, Jesus. Jesus, I give You all of my concerns, requests and needs. I trust everything to You and to Your Holy Will. Thank You, Lord for Your love, Your mercy and for Your concern with each matter we entrust to You. Praise You, Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, you are welcome. I do concern Myself with all that My children are going through. I take each request and go to work for the good of each soul. When souls trust Me to take care of their needs and cease to worry, I can do great things due to their trust and confidence in Me. The more a soul trusts, the more I can accomplish in their soul. Souls who trust in My mercy and love can receive graces to rise to extraordinary heights of holiness. I seek souls such as this to be especially close to My heart. My child, continue to grow in your trust in Me. You are learning. Through this trust, you also experience a greater sense of peace. There is no need for worry, when you have confidence in Me, your Jesus!”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Lord! Amen! Thank You, my Savior. Jesus, have You anything more to say to me?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes, My little lamb. Please write. I invite all of My children to come close to Me now. Do not delay for to do so is to waste precious time. It is also foolish to delay because no one is guaranteed tomorrow. You do not know what may occur that will cause you to hasten to stand before God and give an account of your life, so do not delay. Decide for Me, My children. Decide for a closer relationship with Me. Your souls are precious to Me and I do not want to lose any of you, My children to the eternal fires of hell. Your place, your true home is in Heaven. It is beautiful there. It is filled with souls who love God and love one another. You must learn to love now, or you will not desire Heaven. If you do not desire Heaven, you do not desire God, for Heaven is where God’s Kingdom is, and where He reigns. It is your inheritance. Do not forfeit your inheritance for the fleeting worldly pleasure. These cannot satisfy you, My children. They are only temporary, and they leave you empty and wanting more. You seek to be filled with the wrong things. These things you seek, that you think will satisfy you are not really what your soul longs for, but what you really long for, only I, your Lord can fill. Come to Me and bring all of your sins, your wounds, your burdens. Give them to Me. I will burn your sins in the fire of My love. I will purify you. You will then be free, truly free. Free to love. Free to follow Me with hearts on fire with My love. We will walk together and then your lives will be filled with hope, joy and love. Yes, you will still experience hardship and challenges but they will not be so difficult knowing that I bear them with you and that we walk together. You face much more difficult crosses now, and you do not share them with Me, therefore I am unable to help you out of respect for your free will. Do not think that your life will be boring if you follow Me for the opposite is true. This is simply another lie told by the father of lies. Instead, your life will be exciting for it will be filled with the gifts of My Spirit. It will be filled with wonder and awe knowing that you are truly loved by God and by those who love God. All of Heaven will rejoice when you come into the family of God. Then, you can begin living the Kingdom of God now, in your heart and you will be prepared to come to Heaven on that day that the Lord God in His wisdom and in His mercy calls you home. Be of good cheer, My children, for I love you. I love you no matter what you have done or not done. No matter how great your sins or how small your love. I love you. I love you too much to leave you in this condition and this is why I call you to repent of your sins, and come and follow Me. I will bring you new life. Behold, I make all things new! Come, follow Me.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;My adorable Jesus, how great is Your love. How infinite Your mercy and Your benevolence. Thank You for Your kindness and mercy, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, My child, the day is coming, indeed it is almost here when the heavens and earth will experience a great shaking, to the very foundations of the earth. The sky will grow dark in the middle of the day and fear will strike the hearts of men. When this occurs, I urge My Children of Light not to fear but to trust in Me. I am with you. God’s judgement on the world steeped in sin is coming for the blood of the holy innocents cry for justice. The slaughter of the unborn in your land must cease and if people do not change from their wicked ways and stop the killing of innocents, God Himself will. In His great mercy, He hears the cry of the poor, the vulnerable, the pre-born, the holy elderly who are put to death to relieve the ‘burden of care’ from self-centered, self-seeking, spoiled children. Those who kill the innocents, work for My adversary and if mankind doesn’t awaken from their blindness to grave evil, it will be stopped by God the Father for He is holy and pure. He created all life, out of love. Those who attack the lives He created, those who cooperate, have been given every chance to turn from wickedness. It is not yet too late, My lost children but soon it will be! Convert while there is time. God the Father, in His mercy and love, and because of the intercession of My Beautiful Holy Mother Mary will issue warnings to His children of the impending judgement. This is not the final judgement of the world, but realize My lost children that if you perish during this time of judgement and come before God with an unrepentant heart, it will be your individual judgement. So, do not delay your conversion of heart, for you know not the day or the hour. The warnings will occur because of My Mother’s intercession for souls. When the warnings occur, in the early stages, you must turn to Me. If you do not, there will be no other time for you. What will follow after the great trials, will be a time of peace for those who survive and for those who love Me. My Mother’s Immaculate Heart will triumph. The Holy Spirit will renew the face of the earth. This will be the Era of Peace I have foretold through My prophets and in Holy Scripture. Do not be afraid, My Children of Light. You have nothing to fear for I will be with you. My Mother protects you even now beneath Her mantle of protection. You have been given all you need in the Sacraments. Frequent them often, for the grace you receive not only serves to aid your growth in holiness, but it protects you from evil and strengthens your resolve to resist temptation. You have been given all that is needed. Make use of this, My children.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My little lamb, each family member will be where I want them to be when the time comes, so do not worry. I, your Jesus will see to each need. I am taking care of everything. Be open to My Will in each moment. I will direct you. I will direct My son, (name withheld) and all of your family and your friends. Focus on the time to come, the Era of My Peace when you become weary. When the burden of caring for others becomes heavy, come to Me for rest. I will refresh your soul. Be love, be mercy be light to those in darkness. All will be well, My (name withheld), My (name withheld). All will be well.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You for all You do for us, Jesus! Thank You for Your guidance and direction. Praise You, Lord for who You are, the Savior, the Redeemer of the World.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“You are welcome, little one after My heart. I hold your requests close to My heart and press them to Me. You are dear to Me, little child of My heart. I have given you the first step. You may share it with My (name withheld). Trust in Me for each step in the journey to My Will. Do not run ahead but wait on Me. I bless you in My Father’s name, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit. I give you all that is needed by way of My blessing, My little lamb.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Jesus. I love You.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“And I love you. Go in My peace.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Amen! Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;July 15, 2018 Adoration Chapel&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hello my Jesus ever present in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar. I believe in, hope in, love and adore You, my God and my King. Thank You for the opportunity to be here with You, my Lord. Praise and thank You for Holy Mass this morning. Thank You for (name withheld). Oh Jesus, how I wish he could remain here with us. He and (name withheld) are both wonderful. Your plans are better, though and I realize mine are shallow and short-sighted. You know all things. You know what is best, Lord. Help us to be welcoming and accepting of Your dear, holy priests. We want to show our love for You by loving them.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lord, thank You for our meeting with (names withheld). How I love these beautiful children of Yours. Jesus, I lift up (name withheld) to You and ask You to bless and heal him. Renew his strength, Lord. Both he and (name withheld) are in need of healing of their heart conditions. I entrust all our needs to You, sweet Jesus. You always take care of everything in the best way. Lord Jesus, I place all my trust in You. Lord, please comfort those who are ill, especially those on the (church names withheld) prayer lists. Grant them Your peace. Draw us all close to Your beautiful, merciful Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, our beautiful, loving Mother. Jesus, You know each and every intention and You know my needs. I place each intention with Your capable hands, especially for my children and grandchildren. Lead the ones who have strayed from the Church home and bring those who are outside of the church safely into the Ark. My Jesus, I trust in You. My Lord, I hope in You. My God, I love You. You are everything to me, Jesus and all that I have is Yours. Thank You for loving me and for caring for our family and for all of Your children. Jesus, give the world abundant graces for conversion, for repentance, and for love. Help them God, to know and love You. Help me to do my small part to spread Your love to others and to be Your instrument. Bless the preborn and keep these holy innocents safe in their mothers’ wombs. Bring the hearts of those in our nation back to You, Lord. May our country truly be ‘one nation under God.’ May we be Your footstool, and one day be a light to other nations. Jesus, have You anything to say to me?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes, My child, I hold each intention closely within My Sacred Heart. Do not fear tomorrow, or the future, My little one. I am with you. I guide and protect you. My child, you have heard of warnings, calamities and all forms of disasters. Keep your eyes on Me, My little lamb. I am all that is needed. Together, we will face each storm walking hand in hand. If you become wet from the rain, you will be uncomfortable for a time, but water dries, My child and so will you, also. Storms will come against you, but in the shelter of My Sacred Heart, nothing will harm you. I walk with you both, My children.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Jesus. Lord, I give myself to Your Eucharistic Heart. Please give me graces to love You more and more.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, there is much I have yet to tell you. I have begun to share My Heart with you. You are prepared and now I will begin to share even more. Little by little I am forming you for the plan I have for you and for your family. My Mother guides you. She loves you very much, as do I. Yes, My little lamb you are correct in thinking that We love all of Our children. This is true. And yet, when I say this to your heart, I mean that We specifically love you!”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, my Savior. I love You, also and I love Your Holy Mother Mary. I love all the angels and saints and I love You, the Most Holy Trinity most. I recognize that my love has great limitations, Jesus and so I plead with You to increase the love for You in my small heart. You can do all things, Lord. Increase my love for Your Sacred and Eucharistic Heart, if You please Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, you are growing in your love for Me. You do not see it, but this is true. My child, do you not sense My nearness to you throughout the day? Were you not lonely on Friday, My little lamb until you realized that I was with you? You took comfort in our friendship, little one and you offered your loneliness to Me. You offered it to Me in honor of My passion. Graces were given to others as a result. I allow you to identify with your brothers and sisters who are alone in the world and by your small sufferings they are consoled. My child, what your mother taught you is true. That is that nothing in this life is wasted when offered to Me. No suffering, no trials, no difficulties are wasted when given to Me. She taught you well, My child. She prays for you from her place in Heaven. She knows now the role you are to play on earth for My Kingdom. She had an inkling about this on occasion, but now she is in the fullness of My presence and all things are known and are made known over time to My children in Heaven. You do not know yourself for I have given only brief glimpses and have explained a little in bits and pieces for you would not be able to grasp your role all at once. Trust in Me, My little lamb, for there is no need that you understand everything. What is needed will be revealed in time, when you are ready. I give only what is needed, when it is needed, and when the soul is prepared to receive what I give.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Lord. I really do not understand the deeper meaning, only that there is one. I see only what is on the surface, Jesus. I am small, Lord. I am incapable of seeing the fullness of Your plan. I only know that You have a master plan. I am honored to do a small part for You, Lord, whatever that may be. I do not even need to know what that is. I am content to walk wherever You lead if only You remain beside me and with me in all our journeys, Jesus. I can go anywhere You Will, if only You are with me. Otherwise, I cannot take even one step. Lead me, Lord. Allow me the grace to always say ‘yes’ to Your Will, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“This is a worthy request, My little child and one that I will honor. We are united. You are in My heart and under the mantle of My Holy Mother Mary, the Beautiful One, the Pure One, the Immaculate One. My child, My child, when the great storms come and the terrible shaking, you will have no fear. It will be like the days when you were in the middle of an emergency with a patient, and I gave you clarity and peace. You had the ability to remain calm and make good decisions. You took action based on your training and there was no fear within you. Do you recall, My child?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Jesus. I remember this well even though it has been years ago. I was amazed by this grace that clearly came from You, because I could never have imagined this, nor could I have even known then to pray for this. You gifted me with this grace and I have not forgotten it, Jesus. I don’t know that I have realized it since then, though Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My little one, you recall how it was with (name withheld). Remember how calm you were in the midst of the crises at hand?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes. I had almost forgotten this, Lord. Of course, I remember. (I haven’t forgotten the event, only how calm I was.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, this is one of My gifts. You have this grace. I allowed you to exercise it in times when it was needed. It will be like this for you during the greatest trials. You will have peace of heart and clarity of mind. You will hear My voice, even more clearly than you do now and I will guide you in everything. You will remain focused on Me, My little lamb. You will work with My son, your husband (name withheld) and you will serve together in all that I need you to do. You will care for all those I send to you and you will have the strength to do the work that is needed; the work I am asking of you. This time of unknowing, I have allowed for you to test you. This test is not to prove anything to Me, but to prove to you that you trust Me even when there is no light to see and when the path remains unclear to you. One day soon MY (name withheld) and My (name withheld) you will understand why I have allowed everything to occur. While it seems My plans have fallen apart, so to speak, they have not. My plan for you has not changed. It has not unfolded as you thought, but it is progressing exactly as I had planned. You will look back one day and reflect on all that has transpired, the seeming misfortune, the heartaches, the betrayal, My call to you to love, to forgive, to be merciful and to be joy, and you will understand how critical the experiences I allowed for you have been to your growth. Give Me your ‘yesses’ each day, My children. All I require of you is your fiat to My holy, perfect Will. Through your ‘yes’, I will work all things for good, My children. All things. My children, I will work all things out for you, no matter how seemingly impossible. The only thing you are to do is to love and trust in Me. This is all, My children and yet it is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;My Jesus, my Lord I give You my ‘yes’ again, just as I did this morning. Please accept this little ‘yes’ Jesus. My will is Yours, Jesus. I give it to You. Give me Your Will in exchange. May all I do be one with Your Will. Jesus, I open my heart to all You wish to give me. There is so much lacking in me, Lord. You are the Giver of all that is good. Give me whatever is needed, so that I can love as You love. I know this sounds ridiculous and impossible but You, Lord can do everything. Nothing is impossible for You.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, I know how you feel and how things appear to you. You do not understand the ‘debacle’ as you call it, with (location omitted). My child, your vision is incorrect. This event has gone just as I wanted it to, though you cannot understand. You will be in community one day, My child, just as the Father in Heaven explained to you. All has not been wasted. I dealt with problems occurring and these had to be dealt with for My Mother’s sake, for your sake and for all involved as well as for those to come. This plan is much larger, My child than anything you can imagine. Do not be focused on the details, which you cannot see clearly, My children. I call you to a deep level of trust and I invite you to heroic love. You must forgive and forgive fully, My children. This is the great lesson of love. You must do so before the next step in My plan unfolds. It is a critical point in your journey to love. My child, you are well on your way, but memories surface and you grow sad. Do not be sad about what transpired. The time for mourning about (location omitted) is over. You were given this time of mourning out of My love for you. This period in your lives was filled with grief. Grief for loved ones who died, grief for your hopes and dreams that seemed to have died. You were given very difficult obstacles and I led you through and over each one. Let this be the beginning of a new day for you in which you move forward, accepting that My plan is broader than anything you can see. Allow Me to lead you, for I know the plan. I see each path and I know the one you shall take.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My son, (name withheld) you must close the door of your heart so that no bitterness, no resentment can dwell there. Only open your heart to the love of God. Open your heart to trust, but do not open your heart when unforgiveness, resentment and anger knock. You must not open the door when evil wants to enter, but protect your household, protect your heart. You have been given a sword of righteousness, My son and it must never be used for self-righteousness, but only for the ways of God. My way is love. My way is trust. My way is mercy. You will become even stronger when you fully accept the sword of righteousness, that yields mercy. Be like Me, your Jesus, and be merciful. Leave everything else to God the Father. You must emulate the Father in His love, His wisdom (which comes from the Holy Spirit). You asked for emotional healing, My son. I am showing you the answer to this holy request. The way I will heal you is for you to forgive all who have injured you. You have been injured, My little son, there is no doubt. The way to healing is through the cross of forgiveness and by this cross you will experience a resurrection. Do not be afraid, My son. No harm will come to you by forgiving your enemy. Instead you will experience My healing, My love and through this, My son you will die to yourself and I will be your strength. My strength, My power through love will be within you. In this way, you will be prepared for the next major step in your journey.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My children, these lessons have been necessary for your spiritual growth and this growth is imperative for the plan and the mission of your lives. It is within your free will to choose, My children. I realize I ask much of you, but remember it is small compared to what I have done freely and willingly for you. Will you continue to say ‘yes’ to your Jesus?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, Lord. I give you my resounding yes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, My little lamb. I will wait for My (name withheld) decision. Allow him to read My words now, My child. It is good for him to read now while he is in My physical presence where I can give him direct access to My Sacred Heart while we gaze upon one another.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Jesus, as You wish.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You for Your goodness, for Your love. Thank You for my husband, for my family. We belong to You, Lord. All that we are, all that we have is Yours. Use us as You Will, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank You, My child. I receive your love, your very heart. You are united to My Heart, My child. Remember that in My Heart, you will always find refuge. In My Will, is your security, your peace. Come to Me with every burden, every concern and give them to Me. Allow Me to do the heavy lifting.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Lord. Thank You for Your direction and guidance regarding my job, Lord. You are wisdom, Lord and I am grateful for Your Perfect Will. (I was telling the Lord about the issues I am facing at work and the difficulty accessing time with the executives. He gave me insight regarding how he gave His people, in past times access to kings and queens and even the Holy Father when needed—such as St. Catherine who was a lay woman although very holy—He reminded me of this and asked me if I thought it would be difficult for the King of All Nations to grant access to executives. Of course it isn’t! He put my concerns to rest. He reminded me to come to Him for every concern and to wait upon Him to work these issues out for His plan. He will bring it to fruition if it is to be and if not, He will provide another way. I am so glad Jesus wants us to confide every concern, no matter how small. He never thinks problems are too small for Him and I never think they are too big for Him!) I love You, Lord. Jesus, help us to take up our crosses and follow You. I know that is difficult for me to do, since I avoid suffering, but with Your help we can do what You ask. Give us the grace to forgive fully and completely, as You have forgiven us. Praise Your holy name, Jesus, now and forever.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, My child, My little one. Be at peace. Be love, be mercy, be joy. Remember, your home is not in this world, but in Heaven. You do not feel you belong here, because ultimately you don’t however you are here for the time My Father has prescribed. Together, we will make the most of it. Go now, My children and enjoy the things I have revealed to you. Reflect on them. Discuss them. Pray about them. May these be a joy to you and another turning point in your lives. I love you and I bless you in the name of My Father, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit. Go now in the great gift of peace which I give to you each day. I love you. Let us begin anew in the mercy and the joy I have given to you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Amen, Lord. Alleluia! I love You, my adorable Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“And I love you, My little one.”&lt;/p&gt;"},{"id":9242,"datePublished":"2018-09-07T00:00:00","nodeName":"Recent Msgs to Children of the Renewal August 12, 2018","pageTitle":"Recent Messages","subtitle":"August 12, 2018","author":"","visionary":"Children of the Renewal","visionaryId":9538,"originalSource":"https://www.childrenoftherenewal.com/childrenoftherenewal","originalSourceName":"Children of the Renewal","lstDateOfMsgs":["2018-08-12T00:00:00"],"content":"&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 12, 2018&#160; Adoration Chapel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Hello, dearest Jesus ever present in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar.&#160; It is good to be here with You, my Lord and my God.&#160; I adore You, praise You and worship You, my God and my King.&#160; Jesus, thank You for Holy Mass and Communion this morning.&#160; Thank You for working through (name withheld).&#160; What a holy priest son he is.&#160; I am grateful that You sent him to us, as well as (name withheld).&#160; Watch over them, Jesus.&#160; Protect and guide them.&#160; Keep them safe from all physical, spiritual and emotional harm.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, thank You for helping (name withheld) to be stable enough to be discharged to her home.&#160; Please work miracles, Lord, in every aspect of her life, especially for her physical healing.&#160; Please also heal (names withheld) and anyone else in need of healing that I have forgotten.&#160; I pray also for (names withheld) and all who do not know the love of God or who do not believe.&#160; Please, Jesus, come against the spirit of atheism and grant these poor souls the gift of faith.&#160; Bring all who are outside the Church into the One True Catholic and Apostolic Church.&#160; Thank You for the Holy Church and for the Sacraments You gave to us.&#160; Lord, protect the Church.&#160; Purify and sanctify us, Jesus so that we will be exactly what we should be, a pure and spotless bride.&#160; Lord, I know the church is holy and as people we are unholy sinners.&#160; Give us graces for holiness so that we will pick up our crosses and follow You.&#160; You first said we must deny ourselves.&#160; Help us to deny ourselves, Jesus so that we may really be carriers of our crosses.&#160; Some people have very heavy crosses, Lord.&#160; Please give them graces to carry such heavy loads, and give us the means to assist them in their walk, just as Simon assisted You to carry Your cross. Help us and guide us when we don’t know what to do.&#160; I love You, Jesus.&#160; Help me to love You more.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, you have been concerned that you do not feel joy when I have said to ‘Be joy!’&#160; You have heard this many times from Me as well as from My priests.&#160; It is true, I ask you to be joy and in order to be joy, you must be joyful.&#160; My child, this does not mean that you will always feel joyful.&#160; On the contrary, many holy souls experienced the dark night of the senses and in some cases, the dark night of the soul.&#160; The desolations experienced by them were very difficult.&#160; Loneliness plagued them, as they seemed to be far from Me.&#160; In these times I am actually very close to souls, however the consolations experienced are removed from them and therefore they do not experience My closeness.&#160; I appear to be far.&#160; In these moments, souls do not feel joy.&#160; However, some souls were able to convey joy to others by smiling and being very joyful in spite of how they felt interiorly.&#160; Think of the example of St. Teresa of Calcutta.&#160; She radiated joy and yet had great spiritual darkness.&#160; This is what I ask of you, to be joy.&#160; Not to feel joy but to be joy.&#160; Being joy and feeling joy are completely different.&#160; Do you see, My child?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus.&#160; I see. Thank You.&#160; It is a relief, indeed.&#160; I am glad You explained this to me.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My child.&#160; There are times you feel very weary and weighed down by the spiritual battles.&#160; When you are in someone’s presence, though you smile, greet them and speak.&#160; You often encourage others and take time to listen to them.&#160; Even when you would rather not, you stay to listen and converse.&#160; When you leave them, they are encouraged by you.&#160; You are encouraged by them, also.&#160; It is in this giving and receiving that My children meet Me, Jesus in the other.&#160; This meeting is one of joy, is it not, My child?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Oh yes, Jesus.&#160; It really is.&#160; I love meeting You in others.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“That, My little lamb, is being joy.&#160; This is what I ask of you.&#160; Be joy to all you meet, including people you do not know.&#160; Also, My children are to be joy to your families.&#160; Resist the temptation to be pleasant among strangers, but grumbling and complaining to your families.&#160; Families are to be joy to one another, also.&#160; It is very important to have a joy filled home, especially so in these days of darkness and evil.&#160; Evil wants to break down the family, My domestic churches.&#160; Do not allow this, My children.&#160; The battle against evil is won through prayer, holiness, love, joy and service.&#160; Sacrificial love defeats evil and hatred.&#160; Be love, be joy, be mercy, My children and pray, pray, pray.&#160; Prayer is your weapon and your protection.&#160; It is both offense and defense.&#160; It is your connection to Me; your communication pipeline.&#160; Reconnect yourselves to prayer and pray with your hearts.&#160; Ask My Holy Spirit to assist you.&#160; My children, when events in the near future occur that will cause much confusion and distress, prayer will give you peace, clarity of mind, and allow you to receive My direction.&#160; Do not wait for calamity to begin to pray, for one must learn to pray.&#160; It takes practice and time to grow to love prayer.&#160; Once the soul loves prayer, you will be open to the Shepherd’s voice and I can direct you.&#160; Trust Me, My children.&#160; If you already pray, pray more.&#160; If you do not pray, begin to pray and begin right away.&#160; Prayer will sustain you in times of drought.&#160; Be people of prayer and God will always be near to you.&#160; Regardless of what the world is experiencing My Children of Light, I want to give you the gift of peace.&#160; This peace that I give will be the kind that passes all understanding.&#160; It is the Peace of Christ and therefore, even in the midst of the greatest storms, My children will know peace.&#160; This is a great gift indeed, My children.&#160; Pray and ask Me to grant you My peace.&#160; Always ask for My peace any time your souls are not recollected, are restless, are unsure.&#160; Ask Me for peace and I, the Prince of Peace will give you My peace.&#160; I have an unending source, My children.&#160; Never fail to come to Me when you are in need of peace.&#160; When souls have peace, they will also know joy.&#160; My Children of Light, oh how the world lacks peace, joy and love.&#160; You must bring these to them.&#160; This is your mission, for when you bring My love, My peace, My joy to those in need, they will see Christ in you, My disciples, My apostles of love.&#160; Do not be too busy to notice those around you, My children for these are the souls in need.&#160; Take notice of them, My children.&#160; They are everywhere you go in the world.&#160; Some are homebound and need your loving friendship.&#160; Visit with them.&#160; Send them cards and call them to encourage them.&#160; Some are ill and are unable to do their daily activities.&#160; Let them know you are praying for them.&#160; Do not let anyone feel neglected, My children for souls who are undergoing extreme trials need much love and encouragement.&#160; Do what you can, even if it is something small to show them your love.&#160; Cook a meal for their family, run errands for them.&#160; Do something, My children for the sake of your Jesus.&#160; I am counting on you to serve out of love, My children.&#160; I love you and I ask that you love others as I have loved you.&#160; You demonstrate the love of God when you give love to others.&#160; You, My children, be the cause of My joy, just as My Holy Mother Mary is.&#160; She never refuses Her children and I ask you to imitate Her.&#160; Ask Her to show you ways to serve others.&#160; Ask for Her counsel, Her advice.&#160; She will not refuse you.&#160; This is a great work I call you to, My children.&#160; Many small acts of love create an environment of love.&#160; In an environment of love, My children thrive and share more love with others.&#160; More and more loving acts create multiple environments of love until My love spreads throughout the entire world.&#160; Do not listen to My adversary, when he tries to deceive you.&#160; He wants to convince you that this little path of love is inconsequential and has no impact.&#160; He tempts souls to think that the only acts that matter are large, grand scale activity.&#160; This is not true, My children.&#160; All large undertakings only occur in small steps and in small acts of love.&#160; It takes many small acts of love, many prayers, many small sacrifices to equate to anything large, but in the spiritual world each soul touched has a major impact for the Kingdom.&#160; Do you understand what I am saying, My Children of Light?&#160; The evil one wants to discourage you.&#160; He wants you to believe that nothing one person does makes any difference.&#160; This is false.&#160; Do not fall for this deception, My children.&#160; Remember when I washed the feet of My Apostles?&#160; The impact this simple act of service had on each one of My Holy Apostle’s souls was tremendous.&#160; Each one was transformed by this.&#160; Each one, open to My love, to My grace, never forgot this humble act of service from their Master, and it changed their perspectives and made them better shepherds.&#160; Acts of loving service touch each soul in a unique way.&#160; You create a bridge between God and souls when you show love, joy and mercy.&#160; My Spirit moves through you to give grace to the soul and in turn you receive grace as well.&#160; There is mutual giving and receiving when one shows love.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Lord!&#160; Thank You for these words of life and lessons of love.&#160; You are so beautiful, Jesus.&#160; You are love.&#160; You are life.&#160; You are joy.&#160; You are mercy.&#160; You are truth.&#160; You are light.&#160; You are my Savior, my Lord, God and King.&#160; I love you, Jesus!&#160; Help me to love You more.&#160; Lord, thank You for Your many, many gifts.&#160; Thank You for the meeting with beautiful (name withheld).&#160; Help me to trust You as much as she does, Jesus.&#160; No, even more.&#160; I want to trust You as Our Lady trusts and loves You.&#160; Jesus, thank You for the beautiful words You gave to (name withheld).&#160; When You told her You are a blood donor for the world it really touched me!&#160; Oh, Most Precious Blood of Jesus Christ, save us and the whole world!&#160; Jesus, by Your Most Precious Blood you do save us.&#160; Thank You, Lord.&#160; I love You in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.&#160; I love You in the Most Sacred Blood and in the Sacred Body and in Your Soul and Divinity.&#160; I love You in Holy Communion, Jesus, which we have as a gift from You because of Your passion, death and resurrection.&#160; Because of Your holy life and death, You shed every drop of blood from Your humanity to save us from our sins.&#160; Jesus, thank You.&#160; I love You, Jesus.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“I love you, also My little one.&#160; Pray for souls, My child.&#160; Sit with Me, gaze upon Me in the Eucharist and pray for souls.&#160; Many souls will perish My child but for the prayers of My children.&#160; Pray much.&#160; Love much.&#160; Be joy and mercy.&#160; For now, be My joy with the gift of your presence to Me.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus.&#160;

Stay with me, Jesus.&#160; Be with me through each day of the week, Lord.&#160; Help me to do Your Will and help me to bring You to others, including those in the workplace.&#160; Be with those who are unemployed or are underemployed.&#160; Lord, I am especially concerned for my friend (name withheld).&#160; Give her strength and courage, Lord.&#160; Help her, heal her wounds.&#160; Give her everything she needs, Jesus.&#160; Provide all that we need, Jesus.&#160; Help my friend’s son, Lord.&#160; Heal him and keep him safe, Jesus.&#160; Help me to love You more.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“I love you, My little lamb.&#160; All will be well.&#160; You are in My love.&#160; Rest in My Heart.&#160; I bless you in My Father’s name, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.&#160; Go in My peace, My love, My joy, My Mercy.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord.&#160;

I adore You, my Lord and my God.&#160; Praise You and thank You for the many blessings and graces You give to me.&#160; (Private dialogue omitted.)&#160; Thank You for Holy Mass and Communion this morning.&#160; Thank You for the beautiful feast day today of God the Father of All Mankind!&#160; Happy birthday, Blessed Mother.&#160; So many things to celebrate!&#160; I am grateful for this beautiful Holy Catholic faith, Lord.&#160; Praise You for Your Church.&#160; I pray for the Church, Jesus, for the Holy Father, the Bishops, Priests, Deacons and Religious.&#160; Purify Your Church Lord and bring us to true contrition and repentance.&#160; Lord, renew Your Church.&#160; Help us to have holy fervor for the Sacraments.&#160; I love You, Jesus.&#160; Help me to love You more.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, I lift up to You, (name withheld) who needs to reconcile with You and return to the faith his beautiful parents taught him.&#160; Help him to repent and come home to the Church and the Sacraments.&#160; Help him to experience Your great love for him.&#160; Jesus, please heal (name withheld).&#160; By Your Most Precious Blood, heal her condition and heal her entire body.&#160; Her children need her, Lord.&#160; Jesus, please help all people who attended the healing masses this week.&#160; Give them the gift of faith.&#160; Bless (name withheld) and give him strength, Lord.&#160; Renew his energy.&#160; Thank You for his vocation.&#160; Keep him healthy, Lord, as he ministers to Your people.&#160; Lord, please take care of (names withheld) and all of my brothers and sisters who are in need.&#160; Grant us Your peace, Your joy, Your love and mercy and protect us all by powerful means of the intercession of Our Lady.&#160; Send warrior angels to protect all of Your Children of Light.&#160; As darkness closes in on its final hour, grant us Your divine protection that we may continue Your work, Lord.&#160; Father, please bring about Your Kingdom on Earth as in Heaven and help us to love as if we were living there now, Lord.&#160; Jesus, I trust in You.&#160; Jesus, I trust in You.&#160; Jesus, I trust in You.&#160; Jesus, cause of my hope and my joy, make my heart a flame of pure love for You.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, My child, I love you.&#160; Thank you for your patience, and your assistance with (name withheld), my loyal one.&#160; I am pleased by your kindness.&#160; It is good to show respect and patience for those who are elderly.&#160; They are My children.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus.&#160; Of course, Lord.&#160; We should always be kind to others.&#160; Not that I always am, but I should be.&#160; You are so beautiful to thank me for something that is expected of me.&#160; Thank You, beautiful Jesus.&#160; I love You!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, little one it is expected, but so seldom are My children kind and loving to those who inconvenience them or disturb them.&#160; It is easy to be annoyed.&#160; Thank You for showing such love to her.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, You know that my love is very small and cannot begin to be compared to Your great love; however, when You love through me it makes all the difference.&#160; You are the cause of my joy and my peace, Lord.&#160; Please love through me, Jesus.&#160; Only You and Your Blessed Mother really know how to love.&#160; Fill in the many gaps I have, Lord.&#160; Father, please have mercy on our nation.&#160; Give us graces to repent and to once again live up to our pledge to be ‘One Nation Under God.’&#160; Please, Jesus, help us.&#160; Intercede to God the Father, by Your precious death and resurrection to spare our sinful nation and give us the gift of contrition for our sins.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, I have given many, many graces to your homeland.&#160; Now, the sin of pride rules in the hearts of man.&#160; If they will repent and turn away from their sinful ways, I will give peace to your nation.&#160; My child, my child, some will repent, but not many.&#160; Mankind is blinded by sin and prefers sin to God’s love.&#160; They worship all forms of sinfulness.&#160; They are filled with idolatry.&#160; They sin against the unborn in the most violent of ways, they sin against all who are vulnerable, the ones who have physical and emotional illness, against children and the elderly.&#160; They have lost all respect for God and therefore for all I have created.&#160; There is no turning back, My little one for they have fallen in love with evil and evil is their false God.&#160; My little lamb, do not be fearful.&#160; My wrath must come as My justice is required.&#160; My mercy has been demonstrated and poured out for mankind.&#160; I love My children and there will come a point in time, in the history of mankind it has always been so, that My justice must cause a correction.&#160; My holy priest son (name withheld) has spoken of this and he spoke accurately.&#160; Even My justice is merciful, for it will cause many to fall to their knees in prayer and through the trials to come, they will repent.&#160; Mind you, My daughter, there will be many who will not repent and they will choose their place for their eternity.&#160; Pray, My child.&#160; Pray and offer your crosses for your brothers and sisters who are in the world and who are also of the world.&#160; Many souls are at stake, My child and this is why I ask My special friends to suffer.&#160; It is for the sake of souls who are in peril.&#160; Continue to offer your suffering for them, My little one.&#160; All of My children, please do this.&#160; You all bear crosses in one form or another.&#160; Bear them for the sake of souls in danger of being lost forever.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, focus on Me and all that I have asked of you and your family.&#160; All will come to fruition as I have said and you will be ready to assist My holy priest sons.&#160; Be open to take them in wherever you are.&#160; I will provide.&#160; Do not be concerned.&#160; All is going according to My plan.&#160; Be full of peace and joy for those who live in union with Me are in My Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of My Mother.&#160; I have sent holy friends to you.&#160; Secure your bonds of friendship.&#160; It is needed in this time of darkness.&#160; Do not become complacent in prayer, but pray with your hearts.&#160; Bring your joys, your sorrows, your suffering and your concerns to Me as you pray and leave all to Me.&#160; Trust in My Will for you and for those I will send you.&#160; Rely on My Holy Mother Mary and your guardian angels.&#160; You will be protected for this is My Will for you and your family.&#160; You have said ‘yes’ to what I ask of you.&#160; How could I do otherwise?&#160; I am God; I am love.&#160; I am mercy.&#160; I am all that you need.&#160; Be confident in My love for you, My child.&#160; Be confidant in My friendship.&#160; I will not abandon you, My (name withheld), My (name withheld).&#160; I will not abandon My children.&#160; I am Your Shepherd and I will shepherd you through this darkness and into the light and joy of the new springtime coming upon the earth and for My Church.&#160; All will be well.&#160; Winter is upon you but winter gives way to spring.&#160; Be spiritually prepared.&#160; I will continue to guide you.&#160; Fulfill My request through My son regarding the green scapular.&#160; My Mother’s scapular is needed now but will be needed even more in the coming Time of Great Trials.&#160; When the trials are at the apex, many miracles will occur to protect My children.&#160; If it were not so, all life would be destroyed.&#160; But remain under My Mother’s mantle and safely in the ark of My Church.&#160; I will protect you, but always be attentive and remain close to Me, My Children of Light.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord.&#160; Spare us, oh Lord.&#160; Help us to be generous, loving and kind.&#160; Help us to share what You have given us, with others in need, Jesus.&#160; You give us all that we need so that we can give to others.&#160; Help us not to stray from Your holy way, Your Gospel.&#160; Help us to stand for Your Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, Jesus, even if it costs our lives.&#160; Give us graces for heroic love, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, I will give you all the love needed to give to others in need.&#160; I have given you a glimpse of what your days will be like, pouring yourselves out for your brothers and sisters, the children and priests I send you.&#160; Do not be concerned about the details.&#160; I have prepared you and My son well.&#160; All will be well.&#160; Trust in Me.&#160; Sit with Me for awhile in silence, My little lamb.&#160; Gaze upon Me and allow Me to do the same.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Jesus!&#160;

I ask also for Your divine intervention on bringing (name withheld) back to the Church.&#160; I give all to You, my Lord and my God.&#160; Praise You and thank You for Your great love.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Thank you for your visit today, My child.&#160;

Adoration Chapel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Hello dearest Jesus, ever present in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar.&#160; It is wonderful to be here today, Lord.&#160; Thank You for Holy Mass and Communion this morning.&#160; Thank You for (name withheld) and his beautiful homily filled with the light of truth.&#160; Thank You for the gorgeous music, the prayerfulness and the beauty of the Liturgy led by (name withheld).&#160; I am grateful for these holy priests, Jesus who are so very faithful to You and to Your Church.&#160; Lord, I am heartsick today as more information is brought to light of the sinful acts, egregious, despicable assaults on young, innocent men in seminary and early on in their vocations.&#160; It is horrific, Lord.&#160; Jesus, You continue to be persecuted by Your own betrayed by other Judases.&#160; Jesus, I am so very sorry and so sad.&#160; These predators have wounded many young souls who wanted to give their lives to You.&#160; In some cases, they may have put the first of many daggers into the hearts and souls of these people who were victims.&#160; Who knows, only You I realize, how many of these victims committed suicide, or lived as if they were dead, spiritually.&#160; Oh, Jesus, please heal the deep wounds inflicted by people who were their shepherds.&#160; Heal them.&#160; Console them.&#160; Bring them Your great gift of peace after so much misery.&#160; Lord, heal Your Church.&#160; Give us good, holy shepherds who will be like You, Lord.&#160; Purify Your Church Lord, or rather, purify Your people.&#160; Save us, Lord from the enemy who prowls about the world seeking the ruin of souls.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, You know of the many people who are ill in our family as well as among my friends.&#160; Thank You for the healing You have begun.&#160; Please continue to heal them.&#160; I pray for (names withheld) and those who suffer from addictions, cancer, lung diseases, autoimmune disorders, emotional illness and protect the vulnerable, Lord.&#160; Protect the unborn, the elderly and all those who depend on others for their care.&#160; Protect the children, Jesus and all the victims of human trafficking.&#160; Help us, Lord to uproot evil, sinister deeds and networks in this country and in the world.&#160; Lord, help us.&#160; Jesus save us from every evil.&#160; Renew the face of the earth, Lord.&#160; May the Triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary come soon.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, My child, I understand your sadness.&#160; There is much I have to say to you.&#160; The Holy Father, the Pope is My Vicar on earth.&#160; His role is to lead My Church, to stand in My place as the good shepherd.&#160; The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.&#160; He is to be father, mentor, high priest, shepherd, brother and trusted counselor to My people.&#160; He is to bring light, My light in the world filled with darkness.&#160; He is to bring the truth to light and to reveal that which is difficult to understand.&#160; He is to admonish sinners, because of My great love and mercy and he is to be courageous in proclaiming the Gospel.&#160; He is to bring peace, healing and comfort to the afflicted.&#160; He is the high priest and is to be holy and wise.&#160; One cannot be wise without holiness and cannot be truly holy and lacking in wisdom at the same time.&#160; My daughter, you must pray for My Vicar, so in need of prayer.&#160; Pray, My dear child.&#160; Pray.&#160; From one who is given much, much will be expected.&#160; Pray for the Church in this grave time.&#160; Pray, all of My Children of Light.&#160; I am counting on you. &#160;The world is counting on you, though it is unaware.&#160; This world is supported by the small number of My holy children.&#160; It is hanging in the balance.&#160; Pray, My children, pray.&#160; Pray for your brothers and sisters who are lost and can’t find their way.&#160; Pray for those who do not know My love or who reject My love.&#160; Pray that evil does not overtake them.&#160; My child, My Sacred Heart is breaking yet again for My people.&#160; You are correct in your reference to those who committed evil atrocities as Judases, for they truly are.&#160; Pray for their repentance and conversion.&#160; Pray for those whom they injured and who were robbed of their dignity as children of God.&#160; The malicious men who assaulted My holy, innocent ones will be severely punished.&#160; I am merciful and I will forgive those who truly repent.&#160; I say to you who are guilty of these atrocities, you brood of vipers, if you do not repent, you will be cast down into the fires of Gehenna by your own evil decisions for choosing to follow the evil enemy of souls, rather than God who is Love.&#160; You were given the holy seal that transformed you into priests.&#160; You were set like a seal on My heart, but your hearts were full of evil, corruption, power, materialism, greed and the evil one used your soul as his playground.&#160; You who gave your souls to the devil, you can still repent for as long as you live.&#160; But, and I warn you, many of you will not repent due to your pride and arrogance.&#160; You will wait until the very last moment to repent on your deathbed but I tell you now, you are not in control of the hour of your death.&#160; I am!&#160; Therefore, repent now while there is still some earthly life in you.&#160; Eternity is a long time for a death sentence in hell.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My Children of Light, there is always hope for even the worst sinners.&#160; When one who is at their lowest, repents and is converted it brings much honor and glory to God, so do not give up hope but instead pray and offer penance for the Church needs your prayers, sacrifices and your holy lives as witnesses.&#160; My Mother’s Immaculate Heart will triumph, but until then pray, pray, pray.&#160; Frequent the Sacraments and lead holy lives.&#160; All evil will eventually be brought out into the light.&#160; Then, everyone will breathe more easily as the putrid air gives way to pure air.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, I accept your suffering for the good of the Church.&#160; Continue to carry your crosses.&#160; Do not be dismayed.&#160; I am with you.&#160; What is going on and indeed has for quite sometime is the battle between good and evil.&#160; It is the great battle for souls.&#160; The enemy wants My Church to fail and he has tried since the very beginning to ruin My Church.&#160; He will not be successful in the end.&#160; My remnant will arise and the Church will be purified as My spotless bride.&#160; How soon this occurs depends upon your prayers, your willingness to sacrifice for the good of souls.&#160; My children, the heavenlies pray for you.&#160; My Holy Mother Mary prays for you.&#160; All the angels pray for you.&#160; But, you must also pray.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, now that more of My children understand the degree of depravity and corruption occurring in the hearts of mankind and in My very Church, you know why I am using so many of My faithful ones to spread the light of faith&#160; When those of My priest sons, depart from Me I will raise hew holy priest sons and will give even greater graces to the princes of the Church who remain holy, loyal and steadfast in the faith and in their vocations.&#160; I will also give many spiritual graces to My faithful children.&#160; My voice will be heard, out of My deep love for My people.&#160; Just as I looked with pity on My people who were like sheep without a shepherd in the days when I walked the shores of Galilee, so now do I look upon My faithful remnant with deep love and mercy.&#160; I am raising little souls to follow Me.&#160; I am raising holy priests and religious to follow Me and to shepherd My people.&#160; Listen to the voices of My holy priests.&#160; Listen to the voices of My holy Bishops.&#160; You know who they are.&#160; Pray for them, for they, My holy Bishops are enduring great persecution from their unfaithful brothers.&#160; Encourage them, pray for them, offer sacrifices to aid them in their most difficult hour.&#160; I saw them during My agony and they comforted Me.&#160; I saw them when I was betrayed by Judas with, of all things, a kiss; and they brought Me consolation.&#160; When the Pharisees set traps for Me, I knew the Pharisaical ones would always be in the Church yet against the Church just as those Pharisees of old, and I saw the holy Bishops of today and their lives, not yet lived, comforted My heart.&#160; My little children, you comforted Me during My crucifixion.&#160; My Holy Mother Mary stood by Me.&#160; My dearest little John and St. Mary Magdalene stood by Me in My great ‘hour’ of agony and the tortuous hours on the cross.&#160; Your future holy lives visible to Me even then were sources of comfort.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“I died for all, the Pharisees, the sinners, the evil children following My evil adversary, the pure innocent souls, the saints and the worst sinner of all.&#160; I died for all, because all are My children.&#160; Believe Me when I say, there is hope for every soul, because I paid the price that only I could pay for My children.&#160; So, pray, pray for your shepherds.&#160; Pray for all souls to come to know the love, forgiveness and mercy of God.&#160; My children, when I say pray, pray for souls are at stake.&#160; Now you understand that indeed the stakes are high; life or death; Heaven or hell; good or evil.&#160; Each one must choose.&#160; Choose life, choose Heaven, choose goodness.&#160; Choose God or choose the father of lies, the deceiver.&#160; It is time for each person living on the earth to make the Joshua 24 commitment to serve God or serve evil.&#160; You must decide.&#160; You must choose.&#160; Speak with Me from your hearts and make your claim.&#160; I respect the free will I have given you, My children.&#160; Choose for God so it will go well for you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My daughter, I know your heart is heavy.&#160; Many of My children feel this way.&#160; If your heart is in such a state, think of how somber My Sacred Heart is and that of My Mother.&#160; St. Joseph’s heart is also heavy for he is the Patron Saint of the Universal Church.&#160; It is in this time, this time of great urgency, that you were destined by God the Father to live.&#160; Yes, My children, you were all destined to live in these days.&#160; You are called to be prophets, evangelizers, little lay apostles, bringing the Good News of Jesus Christ into the world.&#160; You are to live lives that are holy and pure.&#160; If you are not pure, go to Confession, confess your sins and be made pure through the words of absolution I have given to My Church, to the priests.&#160; It is imperative that you, My little followers remain pure and holy to defeat the evil of this day.&#160; Evil will be defeated by My holy children.&#160; Pray the rosary given to the Church by My Holy Mother Mary.&#160; Pray the most holy rosary and the Divine Mercy Chaplet.&#160; Pray for souls.&#160; Pray for the Church.&#160; Pray for the Holy Father, for the Bishops, priests, deacons and religious.&#160; Pray for the laity whom I love most dearly.&#160; Arm yourselves with the Sacraments, Mass and the rosary, My children to stand the test and to be victorious with My Mother on the most glorious day that is coming.&#160; Love, forgive, be merciful as I am merciful.&#160; Be peace.&#160; Be holy as I am holy.&#160; All will be well.&#160; Let us begin.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Jesus for Your words of wisdom and love.&#160; Oh, how we need You, sweet Savior.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little one, I am with you.&#160; Do not fear the crosses I allow for you.&#160; Only walk with Me.&#160; Lean on Me, My child.&#160; I told you I was giving you a new mission field.&#160; It is never easy to go into new territory for Christ, My child.&#160; Even missionaries of today have some anxiety when they are going to a new assignment, but they go with the assurance that I am with them.&#160; This is how it is with you, My child.&#160; I have not asked you to go to foreign lands, but to places in your own land that I need you to be.&#160; Take My light, My love, My mercy and My peace with you.&#160; Be yourself, for I created you as you are to reach all those I put in your path.&#160; All that you are, your skills, your talents, your characteristics and even your weaknesses, will serve you well in your ministry to those in need of My love.&#160; Allow Me to be present with you in each and every meeting with others, no matter where or when.&#160; Call on Me and I shall be with you.&#160; I must rely on My children to bring love to the world.&#160; Love and holiness will defeat evil.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus.&#160; Thank You, my Lord and my God.&#160; Jesus, I forgot to pray for (name withheld) who suffers so much at the loss of (name withheld).&#160; She faces the false accusations feeling very alone and now she has (condition omitted). Oh, Jesus, have mercy on her.&#160; Rescue her from her enemies.&#160; Heal her of all that afflicts her.&#160; Give her respite in your arms, precious Savior.&#160; Lord, I love You.&#160; All that I have is Yours; my heart, my mind, my life, my work, my family.&#160; All good comes from You, Jesus and I return it to You, Lord.&#160; Help me to live and to die for You, my adorable Jesus.&#160; I love You!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“And I love you, My little lamb.&#160;

Adoration Chapel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Hello, Jesus ever present in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar.&#160; I believe in You, adore You and praise You, my God and my King.&#160; I love You, Jesus.&#160; It is so very good to be here with You.&#160; Thank You for Holy Mass and Communion.&#160; Lord, please bless (name withheld).&#160; Thank You for sending him to us.&#160; Protect him, Lord as well as (name withheld) and all Your holy priest sons.&#160; Bless and protect all Bishops and our Holy Father as well as all Religious.&#160; Thank You for their witness.&#160; Bless all marriages too, Jesus and help us to be witnesses to the world of Your love.&#160; Glory and praise to You, my Lord and my God.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, thank You for helping (name withheld).&#160; I am thankful that she received some encouraging news from the physician.&#160; Please heal her.&#160; Help her to recover.&#160; Console her as she undergoes treatments, as she is suffering much.&#160; I also pray for (name withheld), Jesus.&#160; Heal him of (condition withheld).&#160; Calm him Lord just as You calmed the storm when You were in the boat with the Apostles.&#160; Lord, You can do all things.&#160; Heal (name withheld).&#160; Lord, Jesus please give graces for conversion to all those who do not know the love of God.&#160; Help them come to know and love You.&#160; Bring those who have left Your Holy Catholic Church home.&#160; I pray especially for (names withheld) and for those who are outside the faith.&#160; Blessed Mother may Your Immaculate Heart triumph soon.&#160; Holy Spirit, come and renew the face of the earth.&#160; Cleanse and purify the earth, Lord.&#160; Restore our relationship to You and bring everything into right order.&#160; We need You, Jesus.&#160; We are desperate for You to rescue us from ourselves.&#160; The world has become a dark place with little faith and yet there are still many who love You and believe in You.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, protect the little children from the sinful culture.&#160; Protect their innocence.&#160; Protect them from abusive relationships.&#160; Lord, I am very concerned for the holy innocents.&#160; Jesus, please bind our children and grandchildren to Your most holy and pure Mother.&#160; We consecrate our homes and our family to Her.&#160; Thank You for sending me holy friends, Jesus.&#160; Help me to be a faithful friend, mother, spouse and sister.&#160; Bless those with whom I work, Lord.&#160; Jesus, You said to bring all of my concerns to You and all of my friends and loved ones.&#160; Jesus, I bring them to You and lay them at Your feet.&#160; I pray for the elderly, the preborn and all who are considering abortion or euthanasia.&#160; Give them the grace to see and to know that all life is precious, Lord because life comes from You and we are made in Your image and likeness.&#160; May Your Will be done, Father, on earth as in Heaven and may we live as if we were living in Heaven now.&#160; I love You, Jesus.&#160; Help me to love you more.&#160; Jesus, please bless and protect our President and Vice President.&#160; Protect their families from all evil.&#160; Give the President wisdom and right judgement.&#160; Guide him with Your Holy Spirit to be a holy man.&#160; Convert him to the Catholic faith, Jesus.&#160; Lord, sin is rampant and I pray that You intervene soon out of Your great mercy.&#160; Save us, Lord, from these dark days.&#160; Fill us with the light of Your love.&#160; All is peaceful and beautiful in this Adoration Chapel because You are near, You are present.&#160; How I wish the entire world was like this, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, I just remembered that I told (name withheld) I would pray for her, too.&#160; She is miserable, Jesus as You know.&#160; Please heal her, Jesus.&#160; I also pray for (name withheld) that she will continue to be well so that she can have surgery.&#160; Help her to have a smooth recovery.&#160; Bless (name withheld) as he begins his Freshman year in college.&#160; I pray also for all who will begin school, Lord and for the younger students who have already started the school year.&#160; Keep them safe, Jesus.&#160; Lord, I am very concerned about everyone who is suffering so.&#160; Forgive me for my long list of requests.&#160; There is much need.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My child.&#160; There are many needs.&#160; You are correct to bring all to Me, My child for only I can help.&#160; You are doing just what I advised you to do; to bring all concerns and burdens to Me.&#160; I am patient with your requests because I love you and I love all My children.&#160; I am glad that you desire to pray for their needs.&#160; My child, I never tire of hearing My children’s requests, made from a heart of love.&#160; This is what I desire, that all of My children love one another.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little one, what you were lamenting to Me earlier today, about the state of the world and specifically, the state of souls is true.&#160; You are right to be concerned.&#160; As I have told you many times, souls are in peril.&#160; They have placed themselves in a dangerous place, by following the evil one’s plans.&#160; His plans are for the spiritual demise of My children. &#160;My plans are for My children’s spiritual welfare.&#160; His plans are motivated from hatred.&#160; My plans from love.&#160; I have sent My Mother to reach the souls of My children, Her children, so they will repent and convert before it is too late for them.&#160; Few listen to Her.&#160; The time of Her coming to the world to bring the Gospel message of love will soon end.&#160; Too few pay attention to Her and therefore the time of My justice is close at hand.&#160; In the time that is remaining, My children must pray more for souls in need and without faith in God.&#160; Sin has blinded them to the reality of God and they fall farther and farther away from the One who loves them.&#160; The farther man falls into sin, the more blind they become.&#160; They lose the protection of the Almighty and they are given up to their stubborn and prideful free wills, no longer aware of just how perverse and evil they have become.&#160; Their souls become almost as dark as night, for they have extinguished the light of My grace and the light of My love.&#160; Poor sinful, stubborn, prideful mankind, you no longer recognize God for you have blotted all signs of hope, love, joy, peace and piety from your hearts and minds.&#160; Your souls have become putrid from the evil that rots from the inside out.&#160; Only I can purge this infection from you.&#160; Children, pray for the lost souls who follow evil.&#160; Pray, do penance for them and fast.&#160; Many will fall into the eternal fires of hell.&#160; Some can still be rescued, but your prayers, your sacrifices are needed.&#160; Pray for your brothers and sisters, My children.&#160; If only you knew how much My Sacred Heart grieves for My lost children, you would pray.&#160; I love each soul and desire all to choose My Will, My love and to follow Me into My Kingdom.&#160; Come to Adore Me, My children.&#160; Soothe My Sacred Heart and My Mother’s Immaculate Heart which is consumed with sorrow for Her lost children.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, I give you My peace.&#160; I give you the gift of trust and confidence in Me.&#160; When the day of destruction comes, and many are confused and filled with fear and terror, I will give you peace and clarity of mind and heart.&#160; Do not be concerned, My child, I am and will be with you.&#160; All will be well.&#160; I will guide you in what you are to do.&#160; The needs will be emergent.&#160; There will be much chaos.&#160; You and your family are to remain at peace, securely in the refuge of My Sacred Heart.&#160; You will be shielded from much of the damage.&#160; I say, much of the damage, because though you will be protected, you must reach out to those who are injured, lost and afraid.&#160; Be another Jesus, another Mary to all in need.&#160; I will give you the strength, the peace, the wisdom, the ability to know what it is each one needs.&#160; I will work through you.&#160; Love each one I send to you as if they were your own children, your own brothers and sisters, as if they were Me, My children, for all are My children.&#160; I love each one, and so must you.&#160; I have prepared your hearts to love.&#160; I have prepared your hearts to forgive.&#160; I have taught you what it is like to lose much, to be on the brink of losing everything, but by trusting in Me completely, you gained hearts of love and forgiveness.&#160; You grew in trust and confidence in Me.&#160; My children, you must put all of these gifts to use now to help your brothers and sisters who will be in dire need.&#160; First, they will have physical and emotional needs and these must be tended to first.&#160; Patience, love, awareness, discernment can only exist in hearts prepared through and by much prayer.&#160; This is why you must pray and increase your prayer.&#160; The time will come when these prayers will need to carry you into My very heart in order for you to help the others.&#160; Listen now while there is order to your day.&#160; Listen to My Heart beating now while you have moments of quiet and solitude.&#160; Soon there will be little time for solitude.&#160; I must continue to make the soil of your hearts fertile so that through the trials, you will bear fruit for My Kingdom.&#160; Do not fear, but only trust.&#160; I am with you.&#160; You have no need to fear when your God is with you.&#160; You are in Me and I am in you and therefore I will work and love through you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My children, things will not be as you thought or as you imagined.&#160; Do not look to the past or to the future that you wanted, only look to Me.&#160; I am your present.&#160; I will be there for you in the future.&#160; Set aside all fear abut yourselves, your friends and loved ones and realize that I love each one with a far greater love than you and so I will provide.&#160; Recall what I told you awaits you in the Renewal.&#160; Recall how beautiful the world will be in the&#160;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#160;springtime.&#160; That time will come, My children.&#160; Much purification is needed to prepare the way.&#160; It must be so, My children.&#160; Trust in Me.&#160; Trust in My Most Holy Mother Mary.&#160; Ask for Her intercession and that of the saints.&#160; All the heavenlies pray for you and for all souls.&#160; Ask them to give you their prayers, their advice.&#160; All are brothers and sisters in My Kingdom.&#160; You will be united to Heaven one day and you will experience complete total love, complete understanding and complete joy.&#160; For now, you are called to love heroically.&#160; I have given you many blessings and graces. &#160;What you have not received, you will be given when the time comes and you will be given what is needed to minister to those in need.&#160; Frequent the Sacraments, My children.&#160; Again, I say frequent the Sacraments.&#160; Always be prepared for what is to come, for even those who have been given the information of what is coming, will be overwhelmed due to the timing.&#160; No one can know what God knows.&#160; Man does not have the capacity to know and out of My deep love for you, I spare you the details.&#160; You will be given all that is needed.&#160; I have every grace to sustain you and I will give these graces freely, My Children of Light.&#160; You will see many miracles for I will provide what you do not have.&#160; Be at peace.&#160; Live your lives in love; in My love.&#160; Drink from the water of grace by frequenting the Sacraments.&#160; This grace will sustain you, My children through the darkness to come.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, it is already very dark.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My child.&#160; Today much sin is done in ‘secret’ and is not visible (as much) to people.&#160; They are not aware (completely) of the evil of the times for they hide their head in the sand.&#160; They do not come close to the heart of their Savior and so they remain as if having blinders over their eyes.&#160; When the Time of Great Trials, the purification comes to fullness, the reality of darkness will be manifested to even those with their heads in the sand.&#160; All will know and there will be many caught unaware.&#160; It is for these, I have prepared you.&#160; You will also be informed of little children in need and some will come to you in need of shelter.&#160; You will do for them all I have instructed.&#160; They will need a safe place to live as they recover from the difficulties and the things they have experienced.&#160; Be Christ to them, My children, care for them as if they were your own.&#160; My little lamb, you will see all the things unfold that I have spoken of with you.&#160; You will understand then, more fully, what I have taught you over these years.&#160; Be at peace.&#160; I have prepared you and your family well.&#160; I have prepared many others like you.&#160; It had to be so, for My Father is the perfect Father and He provides for His children, even in the midst of such darkness and rebellion.&#160; He is love.&#160; My child, this is all for now.&#160; I have said much and there is much to ponder.&#160; Do not dwell on this too much for I desire your peace, your love, your joy.&#160; There is joy in knowing and loving your Savior, your God, your friend.&#160; There will be joy as you have new souls enter your life.&#160; You will give and receive and they will do the same.&#160; Have hope.&#160; Be hope to others.&#160; The winter must come before the springtime.&#160; When winter descends upon you, you say, this winter is dark and the days are shorter, colder, difficult, but always there is hope for you know it will not be winter forever.&#160; One day, as winter progresses and springtime draws near, the days begin to grow longer, there is more light.&#160; The birds begin to sing again, and the snow begins to melt.&#160; You know springtime is coming.&#160; Keep this is in mind, My children, for just as the seasons change, so will the great darkness that has descended on mankind.&#160; The winter will one day give way to the springtime My holy son, your Holy Father Pope John Paul II foretold.&#160; It will come to pass, My children.&#160; Take heart.&#160; All will be well.&#160; Let us begin the spiritual preparations needed.&#160; Begin right away, My children.&#160; Do not waste any time.&#160; Make each day count for the Kingdom.&#160; I love you.&#160; Be at peace.&#160; Trust in Me.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus.&#160;

Bring all souls to the joy of conversion and healing.&#160; Reunite all Christians, Lord.&#160; Shepherd us, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, I was thinking about the deep sadness and concern, the great depth of anxiety, the Blessed Mother and St. Joseph had for You when You were separated from them as a child.&#160; I can’t begin to imagine how distraught they felt as they searched for You among relatives, then pilgrims and all the people in the city of Jerusalem.&#160; What joy they had when You were found teaching in the temple.&#160; Jesus, there is such joy in finding You.&#160; May all who have lost their way in life have great joy in finding You.&#160; Lead them to You, Lord and give them the joy of their lives.&#160; Jesus, help my brothers and sisters to find You, the Light.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, trust in My plan for the world, for those you love, for those who are lost and for the broken hearted.&#160; There are many things that cannot be understood from the vantage point of those living in these times.&#160; They can only be understood in time, with time and by the light all who reach Heaven will receive.&#160; It is meritorious to trust in Me, especially when you do not understand.&#160; My plan is perfect, because it is for love of souls.&#160; You know this, My child because you have come to believe.&#160; Encourage others in this, for it is truth.&#160; I can be trusted with the best possible plan for each soul.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Lord.&#160; Thank You!&#160; Sometimes we take circuitous routes to You, Lord.&#160; Jesus, there is so much darkness, even in the church now, but it has been dark in previous times and I know You will bring us through this.&#160; I know, because You are holy, perfect, and merciful, Lord.&#160; In Your justice and in Your mercy, You allow mankind to make choices for good or for evil due to the gift of free will.&#160; But, You will not allow evil to continue to the point of eradicating the Faith.&#160; You always have a small remnant somewhere Lord.&#160; I am thinking of the Israelites in captivity in Babylon.&#160; You eventually freed them, Lord, even though they were in captivity because they had turned their backs on You and had rejected You, the One True God!&#160; We have done this as a society, Jesus.&#160; There are many who love and follow You still, so please have mercy on us, Lord though we are sinners.&#160; Help us to find our way out of this mess with the assistance of Your Most Holy Mother Mary.&#160; Jesus, I trust in You.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, you have heard that My Mother is cleaning, purifying, sweeping the dirt and filth and this is true.&#160; All is being perfected and cleansed.&#160; When one cleans house it always looks worse during the process.&#160; Furniture is moved, cleaning supplies are in the middle of the floor, buckets, mops, rags are in sight and everything looks out of place.&#160; This is the way it is when deep cleaning is in progress.&#160; Sometimes it is difficult to see the dust, grime and dirt until it is examined closely.&#160; You have commented before that you didn’t realize how dusty the table was, until the room was filled with sunlight.&#160; This is true of sin, also My little one.&#160; Sinful people do evil under the cover of darkness.&#160; They keep their sins hidden and silence their victims.&#160; Because I am a just Savior, I will not allow evil to continue unnoticed.&#160; It will come under scrutiny by the light of My justice.&#160; Now, My child is the uncovering period.&#160; More evil will be brought out into the light.&#160; It must be so, for the sake of My justice and also My mercy.&#160; Too many innocent victims cry out for justice and justice will be theirs.&#160; The spirit of Judas, the spirit of pride, materialism and greed still tempts those who serve for wrong reasons in My Holy Church.&#160; Pray for these men, My child.&#160; If they do not repent, it will not go well with them.&#160; I have said that those who cause My little ones to sin would be better off had they not been born.&#160; This is a harsh saying, My little one, yet it is true.&#160; Pray for the innocents, but also pray for the perpetrators of such evil for their judgements will be very harsh if they do not repent of their evil acts.&#160; Many lives have been destroyed.&#160; I remind you that I am the great healer of broken hearts and I can deliver victims from these atrocities and raise them to victory.&#160; Pray, pray, pray.&#160; My child, I am with you.&#160; I am with My Church.&#160; The Church will survive just as I have promised, but it will be purified and the cancer must be extricated.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, I pray for cooperation in the hierarchy.&#160; May the leaders, the shepherds cooperate with Your Will and may they stand for holiness, purity and love. Do not allow evil to be swept under the rug, Lord but faced squarely and challenged in the light of Your mercy and truth.&#160; Let us be about the clearing and cleaning to bring about the new springtime.&#160; Help us to get through the time of ‘spring cleaning’, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, My child, it will come to pass but it will be some time yet for it takes time to purify hearts.&#160; Once My Church is cleansed it will once again be a light to all nations and a place of refuge.&#160; Keep your eyes on Me and ask My Mother to guide you.&#160; Hold fast to Her hands and do not focus on all that is evil, but focus on all that is good.&#160; Be joy to others.&#160; Be joyful followers, My children.&#160; I recognize that you are weary from the many battles.&#160; This is why you must seek frequent refreshment in the Sacraments.&#160; You need the graces, the strength that I alone give.&#160; Draw nearer to Me, My children.&#160; This is not the time to run from Me for I have not committed this evil that you wish to flee.&#160; Flee evil and come to Me, for I am holy, sinless and pure.&#160; I am all love, goodness and mercy.&#160; Do not confuse evil acts of those in the church, with Me, the Good Shepherd.&#160; The Church is holy, but not so with all its members.&#160; This is not as it should be, My little ones, however sin entered into the world in the Garden and has been in the hearts of mankind every since.&#160; This is why I came from Heaven, was born of Mary taking on humanity so that I, the Son of God and the Son of man could redeem you.&#160; You have been redeemed for a great price, My life.&#160; I poured out every drop of My blood for you, My children and at great pain and suffering.&#160; The depth of My physical suffering was nothing compared to the suffering of My Sacred Heart broken for those who would reject Me and choose hell.&#160; I was tempted, My children and this was My greatest temptation, knowing I would die for all but not all would choose salvation.&#160; My children, rejection by the ones I love so deeply was the cause of My greatest suffering.”&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, please help those who reject You today, to repent of their sins and turn to You.&#160; Embrace them, Lord in the arms of their Savior.&#160; If they only knew how beautiful, how merciful, how loving You are they would have no fear.&#160; Jesus, heal them of the fear they may have.&#160; Give them courage and humility to turn to You.&#160; You always forgive when we have contrition.&#160; Give the graces of contrition to those who do not see the magnitude of sin.&#160; Help us all to repent, Jesus for we are all sinners.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“This is a good prayer, My little lamb.&#160; I will always have mercy for those who have strayed from Me, when there is sorrow for sin.&#160; There must be sorrow for sin, though or there will only be judgement.&#160; While souls are alive, there is time for conversion, so do not wait, My lost children.&#160; If you wait, it could be too late.&#160; You do not know the hour when you will take your last breath and come before Me in judgement.&#160; Do not put off for tomorrow what you can do today.&#160; I am the living bread, come down from Heaven.&#160; Come to Me so that you may have eternal life.&#160; My child, My child, the times I have foretold are fast upon you, but you must be steadfast in your faith and firm in your convictions bearing all suffering with love for in this way you and all who sacrifice and suffer for the Church and for souls will gain the victory.&#160; You, My Children of Light bear the light of Christ in your hearts.&#160; Give witness to Me, to the truths of the Faith, the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church and in this way, you bring the Good News to the lost and forsaken.&#160; Offer all suffering in penance for the sins of the shepherds who have betrayed and in some cases, harmed the sheep.&#160; Pray for those who persecute My Church.&#160; Remember, when they persecute you they are persecuting Me.&#160; My children, I hear your prayers and the cries of My little ones wounded and betrayed.&#160; I know of your pain, for I was with you when you were harmed.&#160; They harmed Me, also.&#160; I did not stand by as one who witnesses a crime, I was not a bystander.&#160; I was with you and in you.&#160; When you were harmed, I was harmed.&#160; When you were victimized, I was victimized.&#160; Their egregious acts were not done in isolation, though that was their intent.&#160; Sin is never done in secret for I am with those who are harmed.&#160; I am also harmed.&#160; You do not understand this, but it is truth, for I am one with you, My children.&#160; This is the meaning of the passages in the Gospel that whatever you do to the least of Mine, you do to Me.&#160; It is also true that whatever you fail to do for your brothers, you fail to do for Me.&#160; Examine yourselves, My children, be the light of Scripture.&#160; Repent of all sins and confess so that you will be renewed by grace, forgiven of your sins and part of the family of God once again.&#160; You who have been wounded, I know how very deeply you were wounded.&#160; My little children who suffer much, who are full of pain and perhaps even filled with fear, I your Jesus understand.&#160; I, too have been wounded.&#160; I was scourged, beaten, humiliated in My humanity.&#160; I was naked as they beat Me; wounded for their and others’ transgressions.&#160; I, too was innocent, having never sinned, for I AM the sinless One.&#160; I was mocked, crowned with thorns that penetrated the outer layer of My brain.&#160; When I thought I could bear no more I was forced to carry a heavy cross, though I had no strength to do so.&#160; I willed Myself to carry it, on My bloody shoulders, for love of you.&#160; I walked the stony road to Calvary with you in mind.&#160; I saw you before Me though you had not yet come into existence.&#160; I did this for love of you.&#160; I, too was faced with people not only wanting to kill Me, but who were killing Me and I forgave them.&#160; I did this so that you would see that you must also forgive.&#160; You must forgive, My children wounded and betrayed.&#160; Follow Me and forgive your enemies.&#160; Pray for those who persecuted and persecute you still.&#160; Through forgiveness, you will break free.&#160; Do not allow them to continue to persecute you by your hatred for them.&#160; Free yourselves from this bondage by forgiving them.&#160; They committed horrible atrocities against you, My beloved and yet I ask you to forgive as I forgive.&#160; ‘This is impossible,’ you say?&#160; It may seem impossible right now, but with My help it is possible.&#160; You must do this, for your own sake.&#160; Give your woundedness to Me.&#160; Give Me the terrible memories, the guilt, the shame, the fear.&#160; Give it all to Me.&#160; Allow Me to have this, My beautiful sons and daughters.&#160; Your wounds are safe with Me and Me alone.&#160; I am the great physician, healer, friend.&#160; Allow Me to heal you.&#160;&#160; If you do not think you can forgive at this time, I understand.&#160; All I need is your willingness to try.&#160; In your will, say, ‘Lord, I am unable to forgive these egregious wounds, but I know You command forgiveness of our enemies.&#160; Since I am unable to forgive, You must forgive through Me.&#160; You forgive them, Jesus and teach me to want to forgive.’&#160; Pray this, My children.&#160; This is all I need; your willingness to try.&#160; Your willingness to do My Will, though you are unable at this time.&#160; I will take this open, festering wound, and pour graces for peace, healing and love that you so much deserve and need from your Jesus.&#160; I love you.&#160; You did not deserve to be harmed, My little children of love.&#160; You did not deserve it.&#160; You deserve protection, truth, love, a father and brother who will never let you down, who will never desert you, let alone harm you.&#160; I am this brother, this father.&#160; I will not let you down.&#160; I am with you and in you.&#160; Come, let Me help you to heal and to have victory in your lives.&#160; This does not seem possible, I know.&#160; It did not seem possible to Martha and Mary when I arrived after their brother, Lazarus had been dead three days and was in his tomb.&#160; I raised him from the dead, My children.&#160; You can be resurrected, too.&#160; I am calling to you now, just as I called to Lazarus.&#160; I said, ‘Lazarus, come forth!’&#160; He came to life and immediately heeded My call, even though he could not see due to the cloth wrappings covering his head and his body.&#160; You see, he loved Me and he heard My voice and answered, even from his tomb.&#160; You may feel that you are dead in spirit though your body is alive.&#160; I tell you now, that I can heal you and bring you back to spiritual life and I want to make you whole again.&#160; Only I have the power to do so, but you must do as Lazarus and come forth.&#160; You must come to Me, just as he did.&#160; If you cannot, for you have no strength and you are afraid, then I will send My sweet, pure, tender Mother to you.&#160; She will hold out her kind hands to you.&#160; Take them.&#160; Look in her pure, unspoiled eyes and allow Her to guide you.&#160; She will bring you to My tender, loving arms and you will see all that you are hoping for, all that you need, all that seems too good to be true, you will find in Me, your Jesus.&#160; I love you.&#160; You will be safe with Me.&#160; Come, do not be afraid.&#160; You are safe in My Sacred Heart.&#160; I will make you whole again, but you must come to Me and allow Me to heal you.&#160; Behold, I make all things new.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Jesus, my Lord and my God.&#160; Thank You for Your deep love for mankind, for Your children.&#160; Help us, Lord to come to You no matter how much we have been wounded, no matter how broken and bruised.&#160; Comfort the afflicted ones, Lord.&#160; Thank You for Your mercy and Your love.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My Sacred Heart is wounded for love of My children.&#160;

I love Your Sacred, Merciful Heart wounded for our transgressions.&#160; I love You, Most Holy Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.&#160; I love You in the Most Holy Eucharist, in Your Church and in the poorest of the poor.&#160; Jesus, in Your humility, You become bread to nourish our souls.&#160; Teach me to love You in the Eucharist.&#160; Teach me to love You through the crosses You allow me to carry.&#160; Teach me to love You in my brothers and sisters and in those who persecute me.&#160; Teach me to love and to forgive as You love and forgive.&#160; Give me Your Holy Mother to guide and direct me since She followed You perfectly and loved You more than any other human being could love via Her Immaculate Heart.&#160; Help me to be more loyal and faithful to You than I have before.&#160; I love You, Jesus and I want to love You more.&#160; Saints in Heaven and angels ask Jesus to give me graces to love heroically so that I can be more like my Savior.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Thank you, My daughter.&#160;

Adoration Chapel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Hello, Jesus ever present in the Most Blessed Sacrament.&#160; It is good to be here with You.&#160; Thank You for Holy Mass this morning and Holy Communion.&#160; Thank You for my family, my fellow parishioners and friends and for the many blessings You give to me which I do not deserve.&#160; You are so kind, generous and merciful.&#160; Praise You, my Lord and my God.&#160; Lord, thank You for Scripture and for the teachings of Holy Mother Church.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, please comfort, heal and console all who are ill.&#160; Thank You, Lord for healing (name withheld)!&#160; Praise You, great physician and healer.&#160; Thank You for Your merciful love.&#160; Please help all who are ill especially (names withheld), all who suffer from cancer and Alzheimer’s.&#160; Please heal (name withheld) and restore faith in You to (names withheld) and their families.&#160; Please bring about reconciliation with Your Church all who have left including (names withheld) and all fallen away Christians.&#160; I pray that (names withheld) and all their families will be converted and all non-baptized will come through the waters of Baptism in the Holy Catholic Church.&#160; Cover all those who hope in, believe in, and love You with Your holy mantle of protection.&#160; Bless and protect all who have refuges to provide for people during the Time of Great Trials.&#160; Help us Lord in this hour of great need.&#160; Be with us Lord and keep us close to Your Sacred Heart.&#160; I love You, my Jesus.&#160; Help me to love You even more.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord Jesus, have You anything to say to me?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes.&#160; Please write My daughter.&#160; Today there is little love and very little faith.&#160; Peace in the hearts of mankind has been lost, therefore peace in the homes and in the nations is threatened.&#160; Mankind, busy about many things that are of no consequence, does not notice even family members and friends, let alone strangers.&#160; There is much hustle and bustle as people race from one event to the next from meeting to meeting, concert, to restaurant, work and play, but no time for the Lord God who created the world and mankind.&#160; No time to give thanks for all I have given to each and every person.&#160; There is no time for God and no time for one another.&#160; Even when families are together each person is doing something disconnected from one another.&#160; If they do sit together, the children are hushed so as not to interfere with the entertainment of the moment.&#160; This is not family life, My children, because you are not living, but only existing.&#160; Take the time to talk with one another, to rest, to pray and even to play together with your children.&#160; By doing so, you will be showing respect and care for one another.&#160; When you do your chores around the house, include your children in the work.&#160; Teach them responsibility and respect for the things provided to you by the work of your hands and the blessings of God.&#160; Do not allow your children to be detached from you and from your home.&#160; Do not allow them to think that you, the parents, are their servants.&#160; This is not wise parenting.&#160; Teach them to do things for you and show them your joy that they are doing something to please you. &#160;They will learn to love through work and sacrifice when they make something or do something needed.&#160; Even though young children cannot accomplish the work as you would, it is still worthwhile and good.&#160; Be pleased when they show effort.&#160; Encourage them.&#160; You are showing gratitude and this is how they will grow in virtue and gratitude to you and for God.&#160; Be thoughtful and kind to one another.&#160; Do not put your entertainment first before your relationships.&#160; Live simple lives of work, rest, play, and being together.&#160; This is how the Blessed Mother and Saint Joseph lived and taught Me to live.&#160; St. Joseph taught Me to work when I was very young, by making things for My Beautiful Mother Mary.&#160; Fathers, teach your children how to work.&#160; Start with small, simple chores.&#160; Show them what to do, then praise them when they have completed the task.&#160; Teach them to do things for their mother and in this way, they learn respect and love for their mothers.&#160; Doing small things for one another, being grateful for what they do for you is something basic that everyone can do.&#160; This is a simple step on the path to holiness, My children.&#160; Teach your children to do simple acts of kindness for one another and in this way, they are also showing love for God who made each person in His image and likeness.&#160; This is true for everyone, even My children who are adults.&#160; You may think, ‘This is too simple, Lord.&#160; Surely You aren’t speaking to me?&#160; I already know to be kind.’&#160; To which I say, ‘You may know this, but are you doing something kind and loving each day for someone else?&#160; Are you taking time to speak to those you pass each day as you hurry on your way?&#160; Are you being love to your family members and making your homes a place of simplicity, peacefulness and love?’&#160; You may know this, but I want you to renew your commitment and faithfulness for this is one way of living the Gospel.&#160; My children, I realize that many of My faithful ones do not have the home life, the family, the faith being lived by others, that you desire to have.&#160; You are Mine though and I am yours and therefore you are called to live with this love, the love I give you.&#160; You are called to love the other who does not know love, who does not even act as though they desire love.&#160; You must love them.&#160; You may be the only person on earth who will teach them about My love by giving them love.&#160; They may have hurt you time and again, (I am not referring to physical wounds but emotional disappointments or wounds) but you must forgive and love as I have loved.&#160; Remember, I died for you so that you would have salvation and so that you would know how much I love you.&#160; When others do not show love, show them love and mercy.&#160; Be kind, even when they do not return kindness.&#160; Pray for them, My children.&#160; Pray and forgive.&#160; Be at peace for you have a beautiful Father in Heaven who loves you.&#160; He is with you as I am with you.&#160; Be at peace.&#160; All the love you give to those who do not love you in return, will be showered upon you in Heaven.&#160; You will receive this and so much more.&#160; Do not worry, for I see everything, My children.&#160; I know each kind turn you have done for another, each and every smile, every nice and thoughtful act of service done in private and every prayer.&#160; I know every kind word, every time you listened attentively and with love.&#160; I know how you were received and if you felt unappreciated, know that I appreciate you.&#160; I care for you.&#160; I am interested in all that you have to say and I love you.&#160; Nothing you do out of love is ever wasted.&#160; No sacrifice, no prayer, no act of love, no good thought, nothing, nothing is wasted.&#160; Do all for the love of My children for in this way you do it for Me.&#160; I am love, My children.&#160; I am truth.&#160; I am mercy.&#160; One day, your family members will understand and if they do not learn to love by the way you love them on earth, they will know later when they are either in purgatory or living in the joy of Heaven where all are completely understood, known and loved.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Be at peace, even in trying circumstances for I am with you.&#160; Your time on earth is fleeting compared to your time in Heaven, so continue to love and serve.&#160; If you have not been one who loves, then go to Confession now and begin anew.&#160; Each soul on earth can begin anew and it is especially easy for souls who have access to the Sacraments.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;You make everything sound simple, Jesus, and it is simple, but not easy.&#160; Lord, it is very challenging for some, especially those in difficult situations in their families.&#160; But, I know You are completely aware of each person’s individual situation and You are with them, Lord.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My little lamb.&#160; Some have very difficult family lives or just one or two very challenging and hard to love family members.&#160; This message is especially for them.&#160; The more challenging the situation, the more meritorious and heroic the love.&#160; It is never easy to love those who do not love in return and yet it must be the way for all Christians.&#160; How will the world know love if My love is not given away for free?&#160; Love freely given, with joy for the sake of love is the way to penetrate hard heartedness, My children.&#160; Even pagans respond to unconditional love and kindness.&#160; This is living the Gospel.&#160; My children I am not speaking about remaining in the home of one who threatens your life or is harming your children.&#160; In these cases, it is not loving to remain in physically harmful environments.&#160; You must protect yourselves and your children from this type of evil.&#160; Still, you are to forgive and pray for those who have injured you while remaining in a safe place.&#160; I am referring to loving and showing love to family members who do not know Me or do not love Me.&#160; I am referring to family members who are occupied with the things of this world versus those of Heaven and salvation.&#160; You must be loving, patient and kind to all family members.&#160; The little souls in your care need to see love in their parents.&#160; They learn from watching you.&#160; What are you teaching them that they will take to their own families some day?&#160; Are you teaching them to leave you alone?&#160; Are you teaching them to constantly entertain themselves with video games and all forms of electronic media?&#160; I can assure you, when they are grown, they will have been taught well to leave you alone and to entertain themselves.&#160; They will have learned to be very self-centered and to neglect their parents and in turn their own children.&#160; My Children of Light, wake up and realize this is not the plan God has for families.&#160; Families are the domestic church.&#160; If you are not living this way, it is time now to change.&#160; Live simple, quiet, beautiful lives.&#160; Teach your children skills for living.&#160; If you do not know how to do this because you were not given these valuable skills, then you can learn.&#160; It is not too late.&#160; Grow something in a pot if needed.&#160; Teach your children to plant seeds and water and tend to them together.&#160; Do simple tasks with them.&#160; They will enjoy spending time with you and they will become your loving children.&#160; They will not neglect you when you are old, because they will love you as you have loved them.&#160; If you do not have children, there are many other ways you can help another child, perhaps in your parish or in your neighborhood.&#160; Ask one to do simple chores for you, perhaps to work in your yard or to carry something for you.&#160; Give them praise for this.&#160; Call their parents and thank them for having and raising such good children.&#160; In this way, you will encourage both the children and their parents.&#160; If you cannot do this, pray for them, smile when you see one another and be kind.&#160; You never know how much your smile means to someone, but I know children.&#160; I know the value of such seemingly small acts of kindness, and though you forget the number of people you have given your smile to, I know each one.&#160; Make the world in which you live, warmer, kinder, more loving and hearts will begin to open to Me, Jesus.&#160; Hearts will be drawn to you because of your love.&#160; This message is simple today, My children because it is needed.&#160; These are urgent times caused by the lack of love and the absence of peace in the hearts of My own Children of Light.&#160; Mine are blending into the culture, and instead of changing it, are becoming part of it.&#160; Mine are called to holiness, to be set apart because of your unconditional love and mercy.&#160; In this way, the holy stand out.&#160; Others notice your humility, your service, your love.&#160; I do not want you to hide from the world, but to show your light.&#160; To hide from others is to cover your light with a basket.&#160; This is not living the Gospel.&#160; Be love, be mercy, be light, be joy.&#160; Love each soul you meet and each one with whom you live.&#160; It is possible, My children because I will make it so.&#160; I will give you the grace you need.&#160; It is yours for the asking.&#160; I am generous, My children and there is enough for everyone.&#160; Ask Me and I will assist you to love. &#160;Give Me your hearts, My children.&#160; I will water your souls with graces each time you pray and each time you avail yourselves of the Sacraments.&#160; When you give love to your enemies, or to those who are difficult to love, My love will replenish yours.&#160; Come to Me in stillness in the silence of prayer and you will meet Me, your Jesus who loves.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Be at peace. &#160;I, your Jesus, am with you.&#160; I love you and you are Mine.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord.&#160; I love You and am grateful for Your beautiful words of love and wisdom.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“And I love you, My child.&#160; Thank you for writing My words.&#160; I know your fingers are sore today and it is difficult to write.&#160; I thank you for your sacrifice and for the love you have for your brothers and sisters.&#160; My child, I am with you.&#160; Do not become disheartened by all that you must do.&#160; This is a difficult time.&#160; Allow Me to carry you.&#160; Allow (name withheld) My son to carry you.&#160; All will be well, My child.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Oh, Lord, thank you.&#160; (Name withheld) already does so much around the house.&#160; He takes care of so many things.&#160; I feel sometimes that I am not doing my part, but you know this, Lord.&#160; I sound ungrateful.&#160; Please forgive me.&#160; I know that by working, I am doing Your Will.&#160; I am finding it difficult to pray as much as I used to when I wasn’t working.&#160; I miss this time with You and praying with (name withheld).&#160; Please help me, Jesus to find time to pray.&#160; Help me, Lord.&#160; I miss the routine of prayer we had.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, I will help you.&#160; Remember to pray during the day and that I walk with you.&#160; Your work is one way that you pray.&#160; Your classes, offered to Me, become prayer.&#160; Recall that I have given you a new mission field.&#160; You are taking Me to others, My daughter.&#160; I will help you to adjust to this new schedule.&#160; Bring your concerns to Me and do not worry.&#160; I, your Jesus, will carry you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord.&#160; I am counting on it!&#160; I love you.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“And I love you.&#160; Now you may sit quietly with Me, My little one.&#160; Let us enjoy one another’s company.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Lord. Thank You, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“I bless you, My child with the sign of My cross.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Amen, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Go in My peace.”&lt;/p&gt;"},{"id":9643,"datePublished":"2019-03-12T00:00:00","nodeName":"12-09 Msg from Our Lord","pageTitle":"Message from Our Lord","subtitle":"December 9th, 2018","author":"","visionary":"Children of the Renewal","visionaryId":9538,"originalSource":"","originalSourceName":"","lstDateOfMsgs":["2018-12-09T00:00:00"],"content":"&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adoration Chapel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Hello, Jesus present in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar.&#160; It is good to be here with You, Lord.&#160; Thank You for Holy Mass and Communion and for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception yesterday.&#160; Lord, thank You for helping me with my studies, for giving me clarity regarding what I should do going forward.&#160; Thank You for Your direction, Lord.&#160; Praise You, Lord for Your kindness, mercy and love.&#160; You are love, Lord.&#160; You are mercy and truth.&#160; Jesus, I believe in the power of Your name.&#160; In Your name I pray for (name withheld) who is very ill.&#160; Help her, Jesus to believe.&#160; Help her, Jesus.&#160; Heal her, Lord and give her all the graces her soul needs.&#160; Jesus, I pray also for (name withheld).&#160; Heal her by Your holy name and by Your precious blood.&#160; She is so ill, Lord but if You just say the word, (names withheld) will be healed.&#160; Jesus, I need healing, also.&#160; Please give me a loving heart.&#160; Give me the graces to love heroically, Lord.&#160; I should be more loving by now, Jesus and yet I am still very flawed.&#160; Heal me, Lord.&#160; Help me to be more generous, more sacrificial in my love.&#160; Help me, Jesus not to complain.&#160; After all, I have many, many blessings and Your love, which I do not deserve but for which I am very grateful.&#160; Thank You, Lord.&#160; Please bring those who have wandered from the faith back home again.&#160; Bring those who are outside of the faith into Your family, Lord.&#160; May all people of good will be converted this Advent Jesus so we can properly receive You, the Lord God on Christmas morning.&#160; I love You, Jesus, my Savior, my Beloved.&#160; Make my heart a flame of pure love for thee.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, My child, all of My children, prepare your hearts now.&#160; Prepare your hearts for My coming at Christmas time.&#160; Prepare your hearts just as the angels prepared the shepherds for Christmas Eve.&#160; They came singing Alleluia and Gloria, announcing My birth.&#160; The shepherds did not think that angels would appear to them, nor that they were of high esteem, so were not expecting to be the first adorers of God sent to earth.&#160; Yet, they had open hearts and stood in awe of the angels and of their proclamation.&#160; Their ‘Glorias’ filled the heavens with magnificent music so sweet was the sound of the coming of the Messiah and the words all good Jews longed to hear.&#160; So long had the Jews awaited their Messiah, yet the poor shepherds did not understand in their humility how they could witness such a magnificent scene.&#160; Still, realizing they were poor shepherds, with no gifts to bring, thought of My needs.&#160; They thought, as good parents, how uncomfortable I would be lying in a manger and so they brought soft, warm fleece to keep Me warm and to lie on in the manger.&#160; They brought milk for Me to drink until My Mother’s milk came in and they brought a lamb, a firstborn to give My parents.&#160; They were poor, but they brought the best of what they had.&#160; They brought loving humble hearts.&#160; The younger shepherds brought pure hearts and they all came to worship Me, the long-awaited Messiah.&#160; Imagine how amazed they were when they realized I had just been born and they were chosen to be the first to worship and adore Me.&#160; This was a message for all the world, then and now that I came for the lowly, the poor, the humble, not for the proud and haughty.&#160; Though, I love the rich and the poor, the rich have a more difficult time loving and accepting Me.&#160; Especially, the rich who are proud and conceited.&#160; They have a difficult time worshipping the true God because they have erected many false idols.&#160; The shepherds also gave My Blessed Mother and St. Joseph much respect.&#160; They asked what they could do to help when they realized the Son of God was born in such a poor state of circumstances.&#160; Mary and Joseph did not look down on the shepherds, as they had pure hearts and were filled with love.&#160; They marveled as the shepherds recounted the angels, the singing, the telling of My birth and where and how to find Me.&#160; What a sacred, holy night this was.&#160; How beautiful and pure My parents.&#160; There was much love, beauty and peace because of their deep love for God and their willingness to serve Me and do the Will of the Father.&#160; Oh, how beautiful are the humble souls who love God, who call Him Father, who adore Him, praise Him and glorify Him and yet who also call God friend.&#160; Remember, My children there can be deep joy in simplicity and in detachment from material things.&#160; The shepherds, as poor as they were, gave thoughtful, practical gifts.&#160; Even the Magi, with their gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh gave practical gifts that were put to good use.&#160; Just as God the Father provided for Me, so shall He provide for each one of you in your need.&#160; He does so directly and also through others who love and serve Him.&#160; Take care of one another, My children and when you are generous, you imitate God, your Father who withholds nothing from you, even to the point of sharing His home with you one day when you are ready to come to Him.&#160; There is nothing needed in life that We withhold from you.&#160; You may wonder, then why there are those who are poor.&#160; This is only because the world does not love.&#160; There is enough for everyone, but many who have been made rich through the mercy of God refuse to share what they have with those in need.&#160; Do not ignore the plight of your brothers and sisters in need because you think they have not worked as hard as you or because you think they are less deserving.&#160; They may be more deserving than you, My children.&#160; You have the poor with you to teach you generosity.&#160; If you do not share, do not blame Me that they are poor.&#160; They are blessed spiritually and many of them will have a high place in Heaven because of their hearts.&#160; They help one another even though they have nothing.&#160; While you who have everything will help no one.&#160; Do you see, My children?&#160; The shepherds were poor, and yet they were chosen by God to see angels announcing My birth.&#160; They were chosen to see Me at My birth, to be the first to adore and worship Me.&#160; Besides Mary and St. Joseph, they were the first Christians, for they believed even before seeing Me.&#160; Out of their poverty, they brought gifts to comfort Me.&#160; I came for all peoples yet often only the poor truly love Me and open their hearts out of generosity.&#160; Be like the shepherds, My children.&#160; Do not be like the Pharisees who often condemned the poor.&#160; Be humble of heart and generous with your love and the gifts I give you. &#160;Remember, if I did not bless you with the means and the intellect, you would not have the material things you have.&#160; All good comes from God.&#160; Share with others and return the kindness of the Father by being merciful and generous with those who are less fortunate.&#160; Anyone in need of love, My children is poor.&#160; It isn’t just those living in poverty, but those who are lonely, those who are mourning the loss of loved ones, those who are ill, those who are lacking in love, who have hardened hearts.&#160; All these are in need of the love of God and they will find this love when you open your hearts and give My love away.&#160; Pray to know what it is I want you to do for the Kingdom, My children.&#160; First, allow Me to be born anew in your hearts.&#160; Welcome Me as the shepherds did.&#160; Adore Me.&#160; Honor Me.&#160; Then ask, as the shepherds did, ‘What can we do for our Messiah?&#160; What can we do to comfort Him and make Him know we love Him?’&#160; Ask this of yourselves, My Children of Light.&#160; Ask this of Me and My Holy Spirit will enlighten you.&#160; Then, in your humility ask Me to show you how to love others.&#160; Pray for them.&#160; Pray the Holy Rosary for peace in the world, and peace in the hearts of mankind.&#160; Pray, My children, but also act.&#160; You must put your love into action to be of service to others and in this way you show gratitude to the Lord your God who gives all that is good to His children.&#160; Open your hearts, My children so that when I come you will welcome Me and invite Me into your homes.&#160; I come to dwell with you in every Mass, but many refuse My graces, My dwelling.&#160; You are like one who opens the door, but does not invite Me in to stay.&#160; You turn your backs and walk away because you are unwilling to give Me a place to sleep and food to eat.&#160; You unite yourselves to Me in Holy Communion but leave Me standing in the cold with no blanket to keep Me warm, no food to eat and no one to love while you sleep in the warmth and comfort of the homes I provided for you.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;This is how you treat Me, your Savior who gave His life for you on the cross.&#160; This is how you treat Me when you judge your neighbor or look at the homeless in disgust.&#160; Remember, this is Me, My Children of Light.&#160; Love your neighbor who is standing on the corner with nothing but the clothes on their backs as you would love Me, for behold I am one with the poor.&#160; What you do to the least, you do to Me.&#160; Open your hearts, My children.&#160; Be transformed by My saving grace.&#160; Be filled with Sacramental graces and transform your lives.&#160; Live for Me, your Jesus as I live for you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;Thank You, Jesus!&#160; Oh, Jesus I am guilty of not serving the poor.&#160; Help me to change, Lord.&#160; Help me to have a pure heart.&#160; Purify my heart, Jesus.&#160; Give me graces for love and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, I am with you and I will help you to continue to grow in love and mercy.&#160; Keep your heart open, My child and be aware of My presence during this Season of Advent.&#160; You will see Me work, My child.&#160; Thank you for coming to be with Me today.&#160; I know you would have preferred to rest at home.&#160; I will give you renewed energy to accomplish all you must do, My little lamb.&#160; We walk together, you and I.&#160; Remember to bring everything to Me, My child and I will help you.&#160; Be love.&#160; Be mercy.&#160; Be joy.&#160; I will forgive all that you bring to Me in Confession and I will give you increasing clarity, My child regarding what you will do and what I invite you to do for Me.&#160; Trust in Me, My child.&#160; All will be well.&#160; I am at work in your family and in your parish.&#160; Do not be afraid, but have confidence in Me.&#160; I am your Jesus.&#160; I love you.&#160; Go in peace.&#160; I bless you in My Father’s name, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, my Lord and my God.&#160;

Jesus, thank You for all You do for me.&#160; Thank You for Holy Mass this morning and for Holy Communion.&#160; Thank You for my family, for my health and all blessings that come from You, Lord.&#160; Jesus, please forgive me of my sins.&#160; Help me, Jesus to love You more and more each day.&#160; Thank You for allowing me to meet the person and hear about (name withheld) for whom we have been praying for.

Jesus, You know all things.&#160; You know all who are physically, emotionally and spiritually ill.&#160; Please heal them all, Lord.&#160; Help our Church, Your Church in this summer of suffering.&#160; Purge our sinfulness, our pride, our haughtiness, our materialism and purify Your Church.&#160; Lord, I believe You that the gates of hell will not prevail against the Church, but there sure is a horrible battle raging.&#160; You, Lord will be victorious, but please spare those who have been wounded the most, the victims and the lives of their families.&#160; Heal them oh great Physician, my beautiful Jesus.&#160; Heal them and make them whole.&#160; Lord, bring all evil to light and purify us.&#160; Lord, a wound that is festering and full of infection must be lanced and drained.&#160; That is what I think You are doing with Your Church.&#160; You are splitting open the infected wound and draining the pus.&#160; Cleanse us, Jesus.&#160; Heal us, God our Savior, so that we can bring Your light to others, free of all infection.&#160; Jesus, there are places where gangrene has set in.&#160; In that case, physicians usually must amputate to save the limb.&#160; Lord, You are the only One who can heal something so severe.&#160; Please heal the limbs with gangrene, Jesus so they do not have to be cut off or separated forever.&#160; Save souls, Lord Jesus.&#160; Give miraculous graces for conversion, for repentance and for penance and sorrow in the hearts of those who have propagated these crimes and those who have hidden them so they could grow like cancer.&#160; Oh, Jesus You are the only One who can resolve this deep, dark, evil present in the Church and in the world.&#160; Come, Lord Jesus.&#160; Save us, Lord.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, there are some who want to become priests, who feel called to discern a priestly vocation but who are fearful of being entrusted to strangers.&#160; They should be safe in the arms of Mother Church but because of betrayal do not know where to go or who can be trusted.&#160; Lord, give them courage and strength.&#160; Show them what they must do and where it is safe for them to go to answer Your call, Your invitation.&#160; Blessed Mother, Queen and Mother of the Church, help Your children and Your holy priest sons and those called by God to the priesthood.&#160; Now, more than ever, we need holy priests and religious.&#160; We need more vocations to the priesthood.&#160; Help us to be prepared for what is to come.&#160; Guide us and show us the way.&#160; Protect our sons, our grandsons Blessed Mother so they may be formed into the image of Your Priest Son, the High Priest, Your Jesus.&#160; Blessed Mother, gather us within Your holy mantle and protect us from evil. &#160;Help us to grow in holiness so that we, Your littlest children can stand with You and Jesus against evil.&#160; May our lives be pure and holy, Mother so that we will be also a sign of contradiction to the world.&#160; We, Blessed Mother, want to love as You love Jesus; we want to love as St. Joseph loves Jesus; we want to love as Jesus taught us to love, but we have so far to go on the road to love.&#160; I have far to go on this road, Blessed Mother.&#160; Take my hand and guide me.&#160; Take me in the footsteps of Jesus, so that with Your guidance, I will learn to walk the way of the cross, which is the way of love.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, My child, My child, it is true what you say abut My Church.&#160; It has been true for some time.&#160; The wound has been festering until it can no longer remain hidden.&#160; Many lives have been shattered by this evil, but I can repair torn and shattered lives.&#160; Believe it, My little lamb for it is true.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Lord.&#160; I believe.&#160; I believe in You.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My daughter, you are also correct in thinking the worst is not over.&#160; Do not focus on this, though for it is My job to clean house.&#160; Just as I threw the money changers out of the synagogue so will I purge this evil from My Church.&#160; They have profaned the House of the Lord, My Church.&#160; They have desecrated My holy ones who are tabernacles of My Holy Spirit.&#160; They must repent.&#160; They must put on the sackcloth and ashes of repentance or truly I say to them, it would be better for them had they never been born.&#160; They have harmed My little ones, some were like My little St. John who loved Me in purity and truth.&#160; They have betrayed Me, these evil men who pose as My priest sons, like the Apostle Judas.&#160; They must repent of their evil ways, approach Me with contrition and beg for healing.&#160; I am all merciful and I will forgive even the worst sins, but I know all hearts.&#160; They must open their hearts to Me so that I can apply the fire of My love like a cauterizing iron.&#160; My child, My little one, do not cry.&#160; Your heart is crying out to Me.&#160; Do not fear.&#160; You have seldom felt My anguish and My wrath, little one.&#160; I know it seems fierce to you, My lamb.&#160; I am gentle now.&#160; Be at peace.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, You have every right to be our fierce Lion of Judah, for You are all holy and we are putrid sinners rotting from our spoiled hearts.&#160; Please save us, Jesus.&#160; Heal the wounds of all who have been victims and who have been robbed of their innocence and possibly from their love for You and Your Church.&#160; Oh, Jesus You are the One with righteous anger for You are God!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My child.&#160; You know Me as your gentle, adorable Jesus, and your understanding comforts and consoles Me.&#160; All who are sacrificing, doing penance and beseeching Heaven, I tell you; your prayers are not falling on deaf ears, for God hears all, sees all, knows all.&#160; Your prayers, your sacrifices have helped bring the putrid stench out of the dark and into the light.&#160; It has to be so, My faithful, little ones.&#160; Trust in your Jesus to do the purging and the purifying.&#160; I am also counting on you to do your part.&#160; Love one another.&#160; Pray and fast.&#160; Especially, pray the Holy Rosary and the Divine Mercy Chaplet given to you for just these times.&#160; Cleanse yourselves in the Sacrament of Reconciliation.&#160; Gather your families and pray together the prayer of the rosary and offer it for the healing of My little innocent ones and for My Church.&#160; Do not be afraid to speak out for the protection of the most vulnerable.&#160; This is the day for separating the goats from the lambs.&#160; Speak out in truth and also in great love.&#160; Be My witnesses.&#160; Bring mercy to those who are in need of mercy.&#160; Bring peace, the peace of Christ, your Jesus, to those who are in the world and do not know peace.&#160; Be love, be joy, My children.&#160; ‘How can we be joy now, Jesus with all that has been revealed?’ you may ask.&#160; You, My Children of Light know Me.&#160; You possess the Holy Spirit who dwells in the hearts of God’s children.&#160; You know and have learned the truths of the faith and of eternal life.&#160; Your inheritance awaits you, and so you can be joy.&#160; You must be joy.&#160; You must also have the peace that I give to you, especially now, My children.&#160; Especially now, for you are My disciples.&#160; You must continue to share My Gospel.&#160; The Church will survive, My little ones, for I have said so and I Will it.&#160; It has been planned before creation.&#160; The Father’s plan will come to fruition and you are living in these evil days because your lives are needed now, in this very time in history.&#160; Your lives, your souls, your love has been placed here at this time, to spread My love and to give My mercy in this time of great darkness.&#160; This is when the Children of Light will shine brighter than before because of the darkness in the hearts of mankind.&#160; You, Children of Light are the Church.&#160; Bring the downtrodden, the victimized, the lowly, the poor, the oppressed, the poor in spirit, into My Church.&#160; Welcome them.&#160; Teach them.&#160; Love them.&#160; It was no different in My days on earth.&#160; Those who accepted Me were the ones in need of a doctor and the ones who were looked down upon by society as well as the little children and those with pure hearts.&#160; They still exist today, My children and they are in need of their Savior.&#160; Go to them.&#160; Love them.&#160; Show them the way.&#160; Be love and mercy, peace and joy.&#160; I will give you every grace needed in these days.&#160; My Mother and Her little army, you, My children, will defeat satan with your love, your holiness, humility and purity.&#160; You must answer evil with holiness and humility.&#160; Look at My Mother and be humble, kind and meek as She was and is.&#160; She is the Holy Mother of the living God and She has nothing to do with evil.&#160; It has never touched Her.&#160; Be like Her, My children.&#160; Pray for this great grace, to become holy as My Mother is holy.&#160; She will guide you and teach you.&#160; She is the Mother of Grace.&#160; Do not be afraid.&#160; All of Heaven will assist you.&#160; I love you.&#160; Live holy lives and be pleasing to God the Eternal Father.&#160; All will be well.&#160; Trust in Me.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, you may go now.&#160; Thank you for honoring My passion and My blood today, My child.*&#160; You consoled My wounded heart.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;I wish I could stay with You longer, my sweet Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, I know My daughter, but you are off on an act of mercy and you must go now.&#160; I go with you and I will be with you all week.&#160; Go in My peace.&#160; I bless you in My name, in My Father’s name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, my Jesus.&#160; I love You.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“And I love you.&#160; Pray, My dearest little one.&#160; Pray.&#160; Be at peace and be love.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Amen, Jesus.&#160;

Adoration Chapel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Oh Lord Jesus Christ thank You for allowing us to visit You today in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar.&#160; I adore You and praise You, my God and my King!&#160; I love You, my Jesus!&#160; Thank You for Holy Mass this morning.&#160; Thank You for Holy Communion.&#160; Lord, praise You for many answered prayers, especially for (name withheld) healing.&#160; Please be close in a special way to all who are ill.&#160; I pray for healing for (names withheld) and all who are on the church prayer list.&#160; I pray also for my friend (name withheld).&#160; Heal him, Lord Jesus.&#160; Jesus, please grant all that is needed for (name withheld).&#160; She is struggling, Lord.&#160; Be close to her and allow her to feel Your presence and a special closeness with Our Lady, Your Most Holy Mother Mary.&#160; Lord, I lay every burden and concern at the foot of Your most holy cross.&#160; Take each one and deal with them in the way only You can, My sweet Jesus.&#160; Lord Jesus, I trust in You.&#160; Jesus, I trust in You, Jesus, I trust in You.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, My child, your heart is heavy with concern for your child.&#160; She is My child, too little lamb.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus.&#160; She was Yours first!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“This is true little one and so I tell you I have a plan for My little, gentle one.&#160; She suffers so and I am aware of each suffering.&#160; She bears many crosses and I press each one to My suffering heart and lovingly hand each one to her.&#160; She bears them patiently, even the painful ones.&#160; We bear them together.&#160; She is not alone.&#160; Many souls from their triumphant place in Heaven intercede for her.&#160; They pray for her strength and fortitude to persevere in the trials.&#160; Her fidelity to the cross provides graces for many lost souls, even the soul of her friends in Purgatory who await their final purification.&#160; Your mother and grandmothers pray particularly hard for her.&#160; She is cherished by many in Heaven.&#160; She is cherished by the Holy Family.&#160; She is cherished by God the Father and God the Holy Spirit.&#160; All will be well.&#160; I have great plans for her, My little lamb.&#160; Tell her so.&#160; Encourage her.&#160; She is being guarded by My Saint Joan of Arc, her patron.&#160; My littlest one, think about your patron and all she accomplished on earth for Heaven.&#160; She was one small soul, but with My grace and through My Most Holy Mother, she went into battle, literally for France and for My Church.&#160; She was just a child really and yet it is the small ones God uses in a mighty way.&#160; You did not choose your patron St. Joan by chance.&#160; It was a mutual choosing, littlest one.&#160; She chose you, also.&#160; This should tell you something.&#160; Reflect on this.&#160; Pray to Me and I will give you insight.&#160; Ask for your patron saint’s intercession in the battles you face, My beloved child.&#160; You face these spiritual battles that are every bit as difficult as the physical battles.&#160; When you suffer, you are very, very close to My suffering, Sacred Heart.&#160; This is where you belong, My child, close to My heart.&#160; You have nothing to fear.&#160; You are where you belong and I will protect and care for you.&#160; Bring each care and each concern to Me, your Jesus.&#160; In this way, you must also release these burdens to Me.&#160; I am your friend and the only one who can solve each problem, therefore do not hold tight to that which you bring Me.&#160; You would not bring a gift to someone then hold tight to it while extending it to them.&#160; Would you, My little flower?&#160; Of course you wouldn’t.&#160; That would be ridiculous, would it not?&#160; My child, My generous one, when you bring someone a gift from your heart, you freely give it to them.&#160; There is joy in the giving.&#160; You must do this, also when you bring your concerns to Me.&#160; Release them to Me.&#160; Then do not worry.&#160; It is alright to think, ‘I wonder how Jesus is going to solve this problem.&#160; I wonder what beautiful result will follow.’&#160; You may think about this, My child and be open to how I may surprise you.&#160; When you give Me a problem, but continue to worry, fret and be sad, you are in essence saying, ‘I gave this to Jesus, but I don’t trust Him with my gift therefore I will hold on to it!’&#160; You see, My child, that is not really giving it to Me.&#160; That is not a way to trust your Jesus with that which you hold dear to you.&#160; My little one, I do not say this to scold you, only to teach you.&#160; I cannot do much with something which I have not been given.&#160; I need to have it completely and with trust.&#160; Then, I am at liberty to do My Will.&#160; Otherwise, out of respect for your will, I just continue to wait until you are ready to fully trust Me.&#160; The longer it takes, the more sad and troubled My little one becomes.&#160; This makes Me sad, also.&#160; What am I to do!&#160; I stand close by, listening, and loving you, but I am afraid I am not as much help as I could be.&#160; Give to Me completely, all that troubles you and then be joyful and await My work in each situation.&#160; You will see how quickly your Jesus can work when I am allowed to do so and trusted with the results.&#160; I can be trusted, I assure you for I have all the answers in the universe because—I am the answer. (smiling) Now, I want you to reflect on all I have told you and decide how we shall continue together in this great plan I have for your beautiful life.&#160; I love you.&#160; Let us begin.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Jesus for Your deep love, Your tender affection, Lord and Your gentility.&#160; I love You, Lord.&#160; May everyone on earth realize how beautiful, how magnificent You are.&#160; Praise You, Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, My child, it is time for My children to realize how close the Time of Great Trials is and the chastisements that will be the climax of all chastisements thus far in history.&#160; Mankind must prepare.&#160; Go to the Sacrament of Reconciliation and be reconciled to God, His Church and to all of Heaven.&#160; Be close to Me in the Eucharist.&#160; Love one another and live the Gospel.&#160; Forgive those who persecute you and who turn against you.&#160; Forgive, forgive, forgive.&#160; Be concerned only for souls.&#160; Time is short now.&#160; Some will lose their lives.&#160; Pray that their souls will be ready for Heaven.&#160; Pray hard for those who do evil, and for those who do not know the love of God.&#160; In these days, conversion is more difficult for evil abounds and souls are easily tempted.&#160; In this day, more holy souls, prayer warriors are needed, but instead I have fewer souls praying.&#160; This means, those of you who are close to Me and who pray must pray more.&#160; It will be possible if you ask Me to show you how to pray more.&#160; Pray from the heart, My children.&#160; Be aware of My presence when you pray.&#160; My Mother is also present with you as are the angels and saints.&#160; Call on them often.&#160; They will assist you in your prayers.&#160; I need you, My children to send forth prayers to storm Heaven.&#160; The earth is very dark, indeed and your prayers are like rays of light in the darkness.&#160; They shine like spotlights and the rays reach Heaven.&#160; It is comforting to Me when you pray.&#160; My suffering heart was comforted on the cross because I saw you praying, though in the future.&#160; To Me all time is one and therefore the prayers you pray now, brought Me comfort then.&#160; I know this is difficult for you to understand, My Children of Light, but it is true.&#160; I saw you, I knew you before you were born and I knew all the holy acts of love you would do for love of your Jesus.&#160; Yes, I knew each sin, also and this is why I willingly died, so that you would be with Me one day in Heaven.&#160; I loved you this much, My children, to die for your sins, before you were even born, before you ever committed the first sin.&#160; See how deeply I love you?&#160; I do not hold your sins against you, My children as the evil one would have you think.&#160; If I did, would it not mean that My death was in vain?&#160; Do you see how false this notion is, My little children?&#160; I died for your sins to redeem you from them and therefore from death.&#160; Why would I hold your sins against you?&#160; Did I not say from the cross, to My Father in Heaven, ‘Father, forgive them for they know not what they do?’&#160; Yes, I prayed this prayer; not only for those who crucified Me and who wanted My crucifixion, but also for you.&#160; I understand weakness, My children.&#160; I understand temptation, even though I did not fall to temptation.&#160; Repent and return to Me, My little children of God.&#160; I am waiting with open arms for you.&#160; I am like the father of the prodigal son.&#160; I await you with open arms and I am ready for you to reconcile with Me.&#160; Go to Confession, My children to be cleansed of your sins and then come to the banquet I have prepared just for you.&#160; Partake of My body, blood, soul and divinity in Holy Communion with your Lord Jesus.&#160; This is the banquet I long for you to attend.&#160; Do not remain on the fringes as one who peers through the window watching the wedding party.&#160; Cleanse yourself in Confession and come to the banquet My children.&#160; I want you here with Me.&#160; I want to be one with you.&#160; I love you.&#160; Be at peace.&#160; Do as I ask, My children for I want what is best for you.&#160; I am what is best for you and I await you.&#160; The time is short.&#160; Do not procrastinate in receiving the God who loves you.”&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You for Your love and mercy, Jesus.&#160; Forgive me of my sins, Lord.&#160; Help me to grow closer to You, My Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, offer your suffering, your work, your studies to Me.&#160; This is also a form of prayer.&#160; I know you long for more time to pray.&#160; I will help you.&#160; For now, each hour can be offered as a sacrifice for souls who do not desire prayer, who do not want to be close to Me.&#160; You are human and can only do as much as your body allows you, for you need to sleep, My child.&#160; I am giving you and My son (name withheld) many graces in this time of sacrifice.&#160; Use this time for Me, by offering this, too as a cross.&#160; I will use whatever you give to Me.&#160; Please try to be more joyful, for truly what you are doing is also a form of prayer and I can use it for the good of souls.&#160; I love you.&#160; You are Mine and I am yours.&#160; We are close friends, are we not? &#160;We are, My child, and close friends understand one another.&#160; There now, so you understand what I am saying and the meaning, My child.&#160; We are friends.&#160; We love one another regardless what life brings and we walk together.&#160; I am always with you.&#160; I will answer your payer about being more aware of My presence each day.&#160; This is a holy request, My child.&#160; It is good that you want to be with Me more and I want this also.&#160; Be of good cheer.&#160; This will soon be behind you and you will see that I gave you all that was needed, both of you, to get through this difficult time.&#160; Draw closer to one another.&#160; Pray together as I have asked.&#160; It is a time of unity with one another and with Me.&#160; Draw close to your family, also.&#160; Even if you are not physically together, be united as a family in prayer.&#160; Your family is much more important than you know.&#160; You will be very grateful to Me one day when you understand just how important each one is for souls and for Heaven.&#160; Believe this My children.&#160; (Name withheld), My son, treasure the lives of your children, your wife, for I brought you together for an important reason.&#160; Many reasons, really but you will understand one day just how precious each one is.&#160; You must see this now as the spiritual leader that you are for them.&#160; This is your domestic church and you are like a priest for your family.&#160; Love them.&#160; Protect them.&#160; Father them, My son.&#160; St. Joseph is assisting you and he will assist you even more when you ask him to do so.&#160; I bless you all now, in the name of My Father, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.&#160; Go in My peace.&#160; Be joy to one another.&#160; Have light hearts so that My light will illuminate the darkness of the world as you go about your duties.&#160; I love you.&#160; I am with you.&#160; All will be well.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Amen, Jesus!&#160;

My patience is untiring and knows no bounds.&#160; My patience is divine.&#160; I await more souls in their conversion process, for I do not want even one soul to be lost.&#160; I love each person created as My sons and daughters.&#160; More souls would convert if more of My Children of Light extended love to them.&#160; My children, I need you to show My love to everyone you encounter.&#160; Be merciful and be peace.&#160; You will never run out of My peace, as long as you return to Me, the source of peace.&#160; Give all to others and return to Me.&#160; I will replenish you.&#160; I am the Prince of Peace.&#160; My children, look around you during this coming holy season and find people in need and then help them.&#160; There are homeless, there are children who are in families filled with conflict, there are elderly people who are unable to go out from their homes; there are countless situations people find themselves in and do not let anyone know.&#160; Befriend them.&#160; Ask what they need.&#160; Be kind and loving.&#160; Many just need your warm smile and conversation to know that someone cares, and notices them.&#160; Do not let each day pass, going about your busy-ness, too focused on your own problems to notice one standing in your midst.&#160; Acknowledge people.&#160; Speak with them.&#160; If you can help someone materially, do so.&#160; When you help one of your brothers and sisters you are being kind to Me.&#160; This is the way to store up heavenly treasures.&#160; It is also the path to My Kingdom.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord.&#160; How many times You have said these things to me and in spite of their simplicity, I do not do this every day.&#160; Help me to be more kind, Jesus and less focused on myself and all that I need to accomplish.&#160; Lord, please bless all who came into the church last evening.&#160; May they always be faithful Catholics.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“I hear your prayers, My child.&#160; I accept them and hold them close to My Sacred Heart.&#160; Prepare, My little one as I have asked with prayers of the Rosary and Divine Mercy Chaplet.&#160; Pray with your families, the most Holy Rosary every evening.&#160; Bless them with holy water each night, and before they leave the house each day.&#160; I will give the children many graces in these days; graces of protection, peace, mercy and love.&#160; My children, and I am speaking now to the young ones, you are not only the future of the Church, but you are also important now.&#160; Your prayers, prayers of the innocent ones avail much from Heaven.&#160; If only you could see what occurs in the spiritual world, you would not find spiritual works to be ‘boring.’&#160; They are in fact far from being boring, but you must have faith for now and do what your Jesus asks of you, just because you love Me and I love you.&#160; I will fill all of My children with much grace when you are open to Me and when you seek Me.&#160; I am sending you out to change hearts, and in this way you will cooperate with Me to change the world.&#160; I am God.&#160; I am your Savior.&#160; I am the Redeemer of the entire world, and yet I need you.&#160; I need you because I love you.&#160; You need Me, also My children and therefore we must work together to usher in My Kingdom.&#160; My Kingdom must first come to the hearts of My people.&#160; Give Me your open hearts and I will fill you with My love.&#160; I will fill you with My mercy and My power over sin and evil.&#160; My Mother intercedes for you.&#160; All of Heaven prays for you and your success in following Me.&#160; Do not be afraid to love, be bold in your love, generous with your mercy.&#160; Bring each problem, challenge and obstacle to Me, My children.&#160; We will resolve each problem together.&#160; We are one, My friends, My children.&#160; I love you and I am preparing you with these lessons of love.&#160; I prepare you as I did My first disciples.&#160; You must be like the early disciples and rebuild My Church.&#160; The Church is being purified now and this purification will continue.&#160; Do not fear if you see the Church growing smaller.&#160; Do not fear the time of persecution that is surely coming.&#160; You will still spread My Gospel and there will be many miracles and conversions.&#160; You must open your hearts now to the love I am calling you to be so that you will be prepared for this time that is coming.&#160; You will be like rescue workers sent out into the pitch-black darkness, but the Holy Spirit dwelling within you will be like your helmet equipped with a head lamp.&#160; You will be My search and rescue squad sent out in the darkness to find lost souls in danger.&#160; If they are not found they will die from being exposed to the elements.&#160; Practice loving now, My children, for great acts of love will be required of you and you must learn now by doing the small acts of love.&#160; Do not begrudge others.&#160; Do not grumble and gripe but do everything out of joy and gratitude, for you know and love the Lord God who is your friend and you have everything when you have Me.&#160; No one can take Me from you.&#160; The more you give away to others out of love, the more you will receive from Me.&#160; Do not be afraid to give your love.&#160; Imitate your Jesus who withholds nothing from you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Jesus!&#160; I love You.&#160; Help me love You even more.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, thank you for being here with Me today.&#160; It is good to see you and My son (name withheld).&#160; Please pray as I have taught you and spend time with Me in the Holy Rosary.&#160; It is important to pray as a family.&#160; Put Me first in all you do and I will arrange things so that all will work out.&#160; I am the Creation of time.&#160; I love you.&#160; I bless you now in My Father’s name, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.&#160; Go in peace and remember that where you go, I go with you.&#160; You are never alone, but I am there in your midst.&#160; Share My love with others who are desperately in need of My love.&#160; All will be well.&#160; Go out in My name.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, my Lord and my God, my Jesus of love and mercy.&#160;

Adoration Chapel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Hello, Jesus ever present in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar.&#160; It is good to be here with You, my Lord and my God!&#160; Praise to You, Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, please heal (name withheld).&#160; Help her, Jesus, she is so ill.&#160; I pray also for (names withheld) and for all who suffer including all who are on the church sick list and Cursillo prayer list.&#160; Lord, I pray also for those who have left the Church or are outside the Church (names withheld) as well as for those who do not know of Your love or have rejected Your love.&#160; For (names withheld).&#160; I also ask for Your healing for (name withheld).&#160; Thank You for Your grace and blessings for those You have healed in my family.&#160; Praise You, Lord!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, please open the hearts of those You are calling to the priesthood and religious life.&#160; Help them to hear and to say ‘yes’ to You.&#160; Bless all who will be at the Bishops’ Conference.&#160; Guide, guard and direct conversations, Lord so that all will be done in Your holy name.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child it is good that you and My son (name withheld) are here with Me today.&#160; These are pivotal times, My children.&#160; You do not understand this fully, but one day you will see in the Spirit.&#160; My little one, you understand, but not fully.&#160; Those who surround the shepherds of the Church are like the vipers in My days on earth.&#160; The Scribes and Pharisees who did not have love in their hearts, but only pride, jealousy and greed were the forerunners of those who surround the Magisterium today.&#160; They bite, sneer and plot in order to lead many souls astray.&#160; My child, I returned their contempt with love and concern for the state of their souls.&#160; I held out peace to them longing in My heart for their contrition, repentance and return to Me.&#160; There was genuine contempt for Me out of what they thought was blasphemy.&#160; I knew this and I had mercy.&#160; But through their rejection and anger, the seed of hatred grew until they were consumed with their evil plans to kill Me.&#160; My child, there was a possibility early on, for their souls, but instead of being open to the grace by seeing God’s Will, by asking for God’s guidance, they began to focus on evil, on their fears for what they would lose if the people of God followed Me.&#160; They were arrogant when they could have been humble.&#160; It was not My Will that they cooperate with evil.&#160; Yes, the Son of Man came to redeem and to save and that involved the cross, but these men did not have to cooperate with evil.&#160; Pagans would have done so, and I would have redeemed mankind regardless, but to have the children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob betray Me was more painful.&#160; My child, you must realize that all throughout the history of the Church, beginning with one of My own, Judas, there have been people who want to destroy My Church.&#160; You must pray for these lost sheep and beg for their forgiveness.&#160; They were created in My image and likeness and they are children of God, also.&#160; Pray for them.&#160; They need your prayers.&#160; Ask the Holy Spirit to limit the influence and power they have over those less grounded in the faith.&#160; They confuse even the wise, but they are no match for the Holy Spirit, I assure you.&#160; There will be a cleansing of the Church first as there was of the temple in Jerusalem.&#160; If they refuse the graces being sent for their conversion, the Father will deal with them accordingly.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;As for you, My Children of Light, be sure your hearts and souls are clean.&#160; Be pure yourselves.&#160; Forgive and pray for your enemies and for those who persecute and wound you.&#160; Then, you will be like your Savior.&#160; You will see what is in store for you in My Heavenly Kingdom because of your purity.&#160; So, focus on the work that needs to be done in your own souls.&#160; Do not judge.&#160; Do not look at those who are less fortunate and judge them.&#160; These poor in your midst, deserve love and peace.&#160; They deserve your mercy for they are My children, just as you are My children.&#160; Make peace and do not judge, but do what you can to assist them.&#160; In this way, you are loving Me, My children.&#160; Be love; be mercy; be peace; be joy.&#160; You cannot bring about conversion in wounded souls by being scornful, angry and judgmental.&#160; This only serves to wound them even more.&#160; You are called to be their fathers, brothers, sisters and mothers.&#160; You are called to love always and to show them the way to holiness.&#160; How can you show them My love when you put conditions on people?&#160; Love them exactly where they are; for then you will be like Me, your Savior.&#160; Be aware, My children that if you judge one of your brothers and sisters, it will not go well for you.&#160; I will not be able to use you to bring about My Kingdom when you act like the Pharisees and Scribes.&#160; Go now to seek the Sacraments and repent of your sins.&#160; The sin of pride blinds even those who are trying to follow Me.&#160; Pride is very deceptive.&#160; It lurks in the sin of self-righteousness, and in the sin of bigotry.&#160; Egoism is a symptom of prideful souls.&#160; You are not perfect either, My children and in some cases you are worse than those you judge.&#160; Do not judge the poor, either My children, even when you can see that their poor decisions brought about their circumstances.&#160; Who among you has made perfect decisions?&#160; Which of you has never made a mistake?&#160; You had the good fortune of having good upbringings or good friends to help steer you in the right direction.&#160; You do not know the woundedness of souls.&#160; Only I know what lies in the human heart.&#160; To think you know better is to put yourselves at the level of God.&#160; Do not commit this sin of pride, My children.&#160; Truly I tell you, you are to love those who are in need and care for them as you would care for Me.&#160; Change your foolish ways before it is too late.&#160; I placed your family members, your friends, your neighbors, and those you pass each day, in your lives for a reason.&#160; They are the opportunities for you to grow in holiness.&#160; Pray and reflect on this.&#160; Ask Me to show you where you need to change.&#160; I want only the best for you and the best is holiness.&#160; Do not fear that someone will take advantage of you.&#160; Everything you have comes from Me, My Children of Light.&#160; I can provide for your needs, but I am asking you to give to others in need and trust in Me to provide for you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“The world has become very evil and still there are many souls who love Me and who are good.&#160; You must spread this goodness, My children.&#160; You must love, even when it does not make sense for this is what I do.&#160; I love you even though you were sinners and then you decided for Me.&#160; Give this same chance to others.&#160; Do not crush their souls because of your bitterness, your harshness.&#160; This is not being fatherly as you believe (falsely), it is condemning.&#160; Love as I have loved.&#160; Love as I love.&#160; Sacrifice as I sacrificed.&#160; Be merciful as I am merciful.&#160; This will be the cause of much healing, much love and much peace and you will see great conversions.&#160; Be patient with those I have given you to love.&#160; Each harsh word; each action made out of pridefulness will be noted, My children.&#160; I see all.&#160; I am everywhere.&#160; You cannot hide your actions from Me.&#160; Do everything in love and for love.&#160; My Spirit is with you and I will guide you.&#160; You must be gentle, humble and meek.&#160; My Spirit will work through you when you love.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“That is all, My little lamb.&#160; You are weary.&#160; Lean on Me and together we will walk towards the Kingdom.&#160; Lean on Me, My child.&#160; I will provide.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus.&#160; Thank You, Lord.&#160; I love You.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“And I love you.&#160; I am with you.&#160; All will be well.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Amen!&#160; Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“I bless you in My Father’s name, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.&#160; Be love to all, My child.&#160; Give others My love.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus.&#160; If You help me I can.&#160; I love You and I will love others, with Your help and Your grace.&#160; Fill me, Lord for I am depleted.&#160; Give me Your heart, Lord and the heart of Your Mother so that I can love as You love.&#160; Thank You, Jesus, for Your words and for Your love.&#160; Amen!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wixGuard&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wixGuard&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 4, 2018 Adoration Chapel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Hello, Jesus present in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar.&#160; I am glad to be here with You, Jesus!&#160; Thank You for Holy Mass and Communion this morning, and also for the beautiful choir concert after Mass.&#160; I’m grateful to You for the Ultreya last evening and for the testimonies of the candidates.&#160; Praise You, Lord that Your Holy Spirit is moving so visibly in these days.&#160; We need You, Lord.&#160; Please pour out Your Spirit and renew the face of the earth.&#160; Lord, thank You also that I was able to see (name withheld) after Mass.&#160; Her heart is breaking with grief, Jesus.&#160; Help her, Lord.&#160; Console her, Jesus and Blessed Mother.&#160; I pray for the repose of the soul of her father.&#160; Lord, please give us many graces during this election period and guide Your people to vote for pro-life candidates.&#160; We need Your grace, Lord to remove the blinders from our eyes and to see through Your eyes.&#160; Lord, thank You for (names withheld) and all those who are so faithful to come to adore You.&#160; Many are elderly, Jesus and they are very dedicated to You.&#160; Where would we be without their prayers and example.&#160; Lord, please be with all who are ill and all who do not know Your love.&#160; Manifest Your nearness and Your love to them.&#160; Help them to know You are near.&#160; Be with the Bishops as they begin the conference, Lord.&#160; Guide them by the light of Your Holy Spirit.&#160; Please bring all who are away from Your Church, home, Jesus especially (names withheld) as well as those who are outside the Church, (names withheld).&#160; Please bless the seminarians and protect them.&#160; Bring us more vocations, and more people who hear and answer Your invitation.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, see Me in the weak and the poor that I send you.&#160; I visit you in them.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Ok, Jesus.&#160; Lord, I don’t see the weak and the poor.&#160; Do You mean You will send, Jesus or have I missed these You are referring to, because I am too blind or preoccupied to see?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, I mean the ones I send to you.&#160; You see them, My little lamb.&#160; You do not see them as being weak or poor, though because you see beauty in them.&#160; You do not focus on what they are lacking.&#160; Just as you see (name withheld), My faithful one who is older in her years on earth.&#160; She is physically weak and she is poor due to her needs, but not material needs.&#160; She is poor in her loneliness.&#160; Your kindness lifts her spirit and helps her to know she is loved.&#160; You saw Me in the man you saw looking in the trash bins downtown.&#160; Your heart went out to him and though he left before you could speak to him, I took your prayers for him and gave him the graces you requested I bestow on him.&#160; My child, you do not even remember the many encounters with others you have, for they seem small and insignificant to you.&#160; I tell you they are not insignificant to Me.&#160; My child, I point this out to you so that you will be encouraged and realize that even though you do not remember, I remember, because when you are kind to these who are poor and weak, you are showing kindness to Me, your Jesus.&#160; I know you are thinking that others do much more than you.&#160; I am not calling you to be ‘others’.&#160; I am calling you to be you and to minister and show love right where you are, in each moment of the day, where you work, where you live, where you pray.&#160; I invite all of My children to be more aware of those around you in every situation of your lives, while you go about your daily tasks, plans and routines.&#160; There is a hurting world all around you, My children.&#160; I walked the earth and showed you what it is to love.&#160; I encountered people everywhere I went.&#160; You do, also.&#160; Your environments are your mission fields just as My geographic region was My mission field.&#160; Think of this, My Children of Light, I did not travel overseas to other continents.&#160; I sent My Apostles to do that.&#160; I did not board airplanes (though we did not have them) to travel thousands of miles for My mission.&#160; I went where My Father sent Me, in My homeland and in the surrounding regions.&#160; My time was brief but I covered much ground right where I lived and worked and the neighboring towns.&#160; My children, you do not need to go far to be My emissaries of love.&#160; You are My ambassadors and you take Me wherever you go.&#160; Do not be miserly and keep Me all to yourselves.&#160; Share the love you have for Me and the love I have for you, with all you meet.&#160; Perhaps someone who passes you in the aisle at the grocery store is in desperate need to be acknowledged.&#160; Your smile and look of love may be the difference between a glimmer of hope and despair.&#160; Perhaps your handshake is the only human touch they will have all week.&#160; My child, you are not passing strangers, you are passing your brothers and sisters. You are all part of the family of God.&#160; You will see them again one day in Heaven and each of you will remember the brief encounters you had on earth.&#160; Do not waste any encounter, for I oversee them all and each one is important in the Kingdom of God.&#160; Small acts of kindness, through love, are very powerful, My children.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;If these small acts are so powerful, Jesus I can’t imagine how powerful larger acts of kindness are.&#160; There are many who risk their lives each day for our safety, Jesus like the police, the firefighters, the military and countless others.&#160; They often live heroic lives and even lose their lives for complete strangers.&#160; The missionaries who leave their homelands, some of them forever, to spread the Good News of the Gospel.&#160; Jesus, it does make the small encounters seem less important.&#160; But, I understand that each and every life is important to You, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My child.&#160; You are correct there are people living heroically each day.&#160; They sacrifice much for their fellowman.&#160; This is extremely important and meritorious.&#160; What I want My children to see is that you, also have a mission field.&#160; It may seem less glamorous, less dangerous, but it is no less important.&#160; I am counting on you, My children.&#160; If you do not extend yourselves to those in your midst, who will?&#160; Many times, you are the only one I send who can make an impact at exactly the right time.&#160; You do not know what is in the hearts of others, but I do.&#160; I know exactly what others need and the timing of your paths crossing is Providential (smiling).&#160; Please be more aware of your brothers and sisters, Children of Light.&#160; You have My light.&#160; You are to bring it to others.&#160; All others.&#160; Your roles are very important to the Kingdom of Heaven.&#160; You are not perfect, I know for I made you.&#160; My Apostles were not perfect, either.&#160; Some were not even as holy as My Children of Light in these days.&#160; Not at first, that is.&#160; They grew to magnificent holiness and love, but they were not at that level when they began to follow Me.&#160; Please do not underestimate what I can do working in and through you.&#160; You cannot do this mission alone, it is true.&#160; But oh, what we can do together!&#160; We will build the Kingdom of Heaven, My children.&#160; It is the Father’s Will.&#160; It is My Will.&#160; You must desire this, also.&#160; Pray for the grace to desire My Kingdom.&#160; Pray for the grace to work to bring it about.&#160; Pray for the graces to love heroically, and then be open to the graces I give to you.&#160; Be not afraid to love.&#160; There is nothing to fear.&#160; Be love, be mercy, be joy, be peace.&#160; I am with you.&#160; I give you My love, My mercy, My joy, My peace.&#160; You give it to others.&#160; Do not judge the lives others are living, for you do not know their circumstances.&#160; I do.&#160; You do not know the depth of their wounds.&#160; I do.&#160; You do not know how they have been treated, and if they were raised with no love in their lives.&#160; I do.&#160; You do not know how many times they were abused by those who were supposed to care for them and protect them.&#160; I do.&#160; You do not know anything about their souls, My children.&#160; I do.&#160; Therefore, you are not to judge them or criticize them.&#160; Only love them and show them love.&#160; Some will tell you they do not deserve your love.&#160; You will spoil them, or they will get the wrong idea that it’s alright to be the way they are!&#160; My children, this is nonsense.&#160; Do I not spoil all of My children by providing sunshine to nourish the plants you need to eat and to make the flowers and trees grow?&#160; Do I not provide the rain to keep you from having a draught?&#160; Do I not provide a nice breeze on a hot summer day to cool you?&#160; Do I not provide the birds, the fish, the animals and the plant life for you?&#160; Which one of you is so godly that you have never sinned?&#160; Which of you deserves every good thing you have?&#160; Did I not give you talents, intelligence and skills to earn a living?&#160; Yes, you cooperate with My gifts by working, but which of you endowed yourselves with these gifts at birth?&#160; None of you, My children.&#160; You know the answers to these questions because they are obvious to you now, but how often do you reflect on these things?&#160; Many are quick to judge those who struggle in life, but fail to see that only by My grace are your lives different.&#160; My children, it is part of My plan to give some more material gifts than others, because you need to be made holy through the sharing of your gifts with others who cannot repay you.&#160; Do you see, My children?&#160; Many of My children who are living in poverty are holy.&#160; They do not like the lives they have, and yet many accept their crosses with humility.&#160; It is difficult to ask others for help.&#160; Do not look down on those who need your help.&#160; One day, everyone needs help, My children.&#160; When you are elderly or infirmed, you will also need help.&#160; It is part of the human condition.&#160; Be generous with your assistance, your kindness, your good deeds.&#160; Begin first with your own families for these are often the most important mission fields.&#160; Do not ignore others, though but go outside your ‘inner circles’ and be kind and merciful to others.&#160; My children, your Jesus did not have to speak to your parents and grandparents in this way, for they read Scripture and they knew how to help one another.&#160; It was part of their way of life.&#160; Neighbors helped neighbors and anyone who crossed their paths in need.&#160; Even if there wasn’t as much financial prosperity, there was generosity and hospitality.&#160; My children of this age are losing the art of hospitality and generosity.&#160; Be more aware of those in need.&#160; Some are not poor materially, but are lonely, grieving or have too much stress and strain in their lives.&#160; Perhaps they are caring for loved ones who are ill and they are working and raising a family.&#160; What can you do for them?&#160; Perhaps cook a meal, or visit with their sick family member, or run errands for them.&#160; Pray for them, speak with them.&#160; Let them know that you care and that you notice.&#160; You may be the only one who extends this kindness.&#160; The world will be a better place, My children for your love. You must learn to live in this way of love now, or you will not be prepared for the life of love in Heaven. &#160;Heaven is all love, My children.&#160; It is being in the presence of Love Himself.&#160; It is the fullness of love.&#160; You must begin to live as if you were living in Heaven now.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord Jesus for reminding me how important each day that You give us is, in bringing about Your Kingdom.&#160; Thank You for making it easy to understand and simple, Jesus.&#160; Thank You for each encounter You give us with others.&#160; Help me to see each person as a blessing and a gift from You, Lord.&#160; Thank You for the many times You have sent people to help me.&#160; Each smile and hug given to Me was really a gift from You and I am very grateful.&#160; Thank You for Your beautiful, unconditional love, Jesus.&#160; Thank You for Your infinite mercy, Your forgiveness, Your peace.&#160; Jesus, You know each and every concern on my heart.&#160; Take these concerns, Lord and deal with them as You see fit.&#160; Help me with the heart condition I have, Lord.&#160; I offer it for all who have broken hearts, who do not know love or the source of love.&#160; Help my children and grandchildren to love and follow You, Lord.&#160; See to each one’s needs and give them what they need for their souls and hearts.&#160; Thank You, Jesus that You hold each person in the palm of Your hand.&#160; Praise You and thank You, my Lord and my God.&#160; I love!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“And I love you, My child.&#160; I take your sufferings and your offerings in prayer, and I will use them for the good of the Kingdom.&#160; Thank You, My little lamb for your love and your friendship.&#160; You may go now in peace, My child.&#160; I am with you.&#160; I bless you and My son (name withheld) in the name of My Father, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.&#160; Be mercy, be love, be peace, be joy.&#160; I will provide all that is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, my Jesus.&#160; Amen!&#160; Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;"},{"id":9501,"datePublished":"2019-01-07T00:00:00","nodeName":"Recent Messages to  Children of the Renewal Messages","pageTitle":"Recent Messages to  Children of the Renewal Messages","subtitle":"September - October, 2018","author":"","visionary":"Children of the Renewal","visionaryId":9538,"originalSource":"","originalSourceName":"","lstDateOfMsgs":[],"content":"&lt;p&gt;October 28, 2018 Adoration Chapel&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hello, my Jesus ever present in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar. I believe in You, love You and adore You, my God and my King. Lord, it is good to be here with You. Thank You for Holy Mass this morning and for Holy Communion. Thank You for (names withheld). Thank You for allowing us to be together at Mass. Jesus, bless (names withheld) who were not there. Please bring (name withheld) back to the Church as well as (names withheld). Please bring (names withheld) into the Church. Lord, thank You for our pastor (name withheld) and for (name withheld). Thank You for protecting (name withheld) during his car accident. Praise You that he wasn’t hurt. Thank You, Jesus for our family party yesterday for (name withheld). Help our entire family to grow closer to You, Lord. Jesus, please comfort (name withheld). Her heart is grieving her Father’s death and not being able to be by his side makes everything even worse. Help her mother to leave (location withheld) and come to be with (name withheld).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Please help the people of Venezuela, Lord to rebuild their economy. Their country has been decimated by their President and his party. Help them, Jesus to regain their freedom and to live lives of holiness, love and joy. Jesus, I trust in You. Jesus, I trust in You. Jesus, I trust in You. Lord, please help all Catholics to evangelize and spread the Gospel so that others will come to know You, love You and believe that You are Son of the Living God, true God and true man. Please grant graces to those You are calling into the priesthood and religious life. Help all to say ‘yes’ to Your invitation. Jesus, we need more priests in our diocese and in all dioceses in the world. Please send us an associate pastor, Jesus. We need more holy priests, Lord. Please see to it, Jesus. Lord, heal the sick, all those on the church prayer list and (names withheld) and all who are ill. Help (name withheld), Lord. He is so stressed now. Help him, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, I know you are very tired and weary. I know and I am with you. Thank you for going to the memorial Mass to comfort (name withheld). Her heart is breaking, but My Mother comforts her.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Lord. Her earthly mother is so far away and (name withheld) is in a foreign land, though it is now her home. I’m sure she feels lost without her father and lost without her homeland. She must feel as if her world is chipping away, in a sense, and yet perhaps she will begin to feel that her true home is more and more close to her. (Heaven)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, this is a painful part of life, having loved ones die and leave Earth for Heaven. It is more painful when one is unsure about a loved one’s soul and the disposition of it at death. Many people grieve more deeply for this reason. It is truly a gift when a loved one who is close to Me passes from this world and is born into Heaven. Even if souls who are close to Me need some purifying in Purgatory, their family can have confidence they will one day be in Heaven. It is not so for those who die outside of the family of God, because of their rejection of Me. But since you do not know for sure, it is a work of mercy to have Masses said for your loved ones and friends who have died and especially helpful for those in the process of dying for the graces of the Mass, applied to their souls before death can bring the gift of conversion. Do not withhold a Mass for souls in need, either in the act of dying or afterwards. Pray for souls in Purgatory, My child.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My little lamb, keep your children and grandchildren safe by placing them under My Mother’s mantle of protection. Pray the prayer I gave to you, for all of your children and grandchildren. This is a powerful prayer for it is a request that My Sacred Heart and My Mother’s Immaculate Heart be the refuge of souls. Be confident in the protection of My Mother and in My protection. Even if some physical harm comes to those in My protection, be confident that we protect souls and this is the most important kind of protection. Be confident and trust, My Children of Light.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Lord. Thank You, Jesus! Lord, please fulfill Your words regarding the matter of the community that will be discussed next week. Bring about Your Will in this matter, Lord. Restore what is due to people, but most of all, Lord, restore peace and love between all. Lord, we have no one to represent us but You. Therefore, we have the best! Father God, bring all to pass as You Will and as You said would be. Make it so, Father for You said You would. All for Your honor and glory, because no man can work out these impossible problems, but You can, Father. You are the God of the impossible, for nothing is impossible for You.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, no matter the outcome, trust in Me. I am the lover of your soul and I do what is best. In this, rest your confidence and your trust. Be at peace. I am God. All belongs to Me. I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end and all that exists, does so by My Will and through My Will. You are My child, the children of God have the richness of Heaven for their inheritance. Nothing on earth, that is earthly wealth, material goods, are really lost if you have the Kingdom in your heart. Remember that where your heart is, there is your kingdom. All will be well, My child. Live out of this knowledge and count on it, for by counting on Me, your soul will have peace and joy.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Father. I love You. I praise You and You are my peace and joy. Give me a pure heart, Lord. Give me a heart for You and only You and Your Will.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“This is a holy prayer, My child. You are growing in this purity and love for Me. Continue this pursuit, My little lamb.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Lord. There is joy even in the pursuit. You make life exciting, Lord, even in spite of the crosses, the trials, the suffering. There is much joy because of You. Thank You for Your love, Your mercy and for the life of faith You give so freely to all who seek You.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, draw closer to the heart of My Son in Holy Mass and in Adoration. All who are close to My Son in the Eucharist, console His Sacred Heart, You are sealed in My love in this way.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, my Lord and my God. I love You. All praise, honor and glory to You now and forever.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, My little child. You may rest in My peace.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Alleluia! Jesus, please protect our priests. Keep them safe and give them graces for holiness. Help us to “minister” to them, Lord as we want to serve others as You served others. Keep them safe, especially with all that will come to pass. Please protect our President and Vice President, their families and all cabinet members. Please help us in the fight to end all violence, especially abortion and euthanasia. Oh, Lord we are so miserable without You. We become worse than animals. Bring about conversion and the triumph of Your Mother’s Immaculate Heart.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, what you spoke about last evening regarding a reprieve is true. Things seem good in your country at the moment, but to remain this way will require the hard work of prayer, fasting, penance and more prayer. Do not become complacent, My Children of Light. Souls are on the precipice. They are hanging in the balance. Much, much prayer is needed. If there is an outpouring of prayer, especially the prayer of Scripture which is the Rosary, many souls will be converted and will be saved. If you all become (and in some cases, remain) complacent, souls will be lost and the reprieve will have been wasted. Do not waste this time, My children for this is not something to be taken for granted, but is a great blessing to My people who pleaded with Me to intervene. I intervened, My children, but you must do the same. Now, you must heighten your prayers and do so with a sense of urgency for it is then that you pray from the heart. Do not be lukewarm, My children. There is no time to waste. Be vigilant and remain actively in prayer. May your lives be a prayer and each activity an act of service and love for God and for your neighbor. You may go, My child and be always in My peace. I bless you in the name of My Father, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit. Go in My love. Be peace, be mercy and be joy, My child.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Amen, Jesus. Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;October 21, 2018 Adoration Chapel&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hello my Jesus present in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar. Praise You, Lord God of Heaven and Earth. It is so good to be here with You, Jesus. Thank You for Confession and Holy Mass. Thank You for Your good and holy priests. Protect them from all evil. Give them every grace needed, Lord to carry out Your Will and mission. Thank You for my beautiful family, for my loving friends and for my husband who is so dear to me. You give every good gift, Jesus even though I am undeserving, but I realize it is because of Your goodness and mercy. Thank You for Your love, which is the best gift of all.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lord, please heal the sick, the wounded and bring them Your peace. Help each soul who is misguided to be given clarity and an open heart and mind to You. Bring all who are outside of Your family home especially those who are away from the Church. Blessed Mother, bring all of our separated brothers and sisters to Your Son, Jesus. Lord, calm my heart and make it beat at a regular rhythm. Heal me, also Jesus. Jesus, I pray especially for (names withheld) and all who are on the church prayer lists. I also ask for special protection for our President and his cabinet, his family and all who lead our country. Give them openness to Your Holy Spirit, wisdom, courage to do what is right, prudence, fortitude, mercy and right judgement. Restore our country, Lord to Your Will. Bring us the graces of conversion and repentance. Help us to once again be One Nation under God. Help us to have respect for Your Holy Commandments once again. Jesus, I trust in You. Jesus, I trust in You. Jesus, I trust in You!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, thank you for your words of trust. It is good that you trust in Me and trust in My mercy. It is very important in this age to spread the message of My mercy and My love. There are many, many souls who do not know or do not believe in My mercy. Tell people about My mercy and the messages I gave to My holy little Faustina. I want the world to know and so many do not. The world is in dire need of My mercy. You are wondering how you, who are little, can do this, My child, but it begins with you. It begins with each of My Children of Light. You be mercy and love to others. Speak of My mercy when you converse with others. Speak of the mercy of God and tell people there is no bottom to the well of My mercy. There is mercy for all, enough for every person ever born, living now, and for all who will be born. It is unendless and it is for everyone. Anyone who repents and appeals to My mercy will be saved. Come to Me, all who are in need of My mercy, and mercy shall be yours. The world is in severe darkness and many souls are deprived of light. I am the light. I will restore each and every soul who comes to Me. Do not wait until it is too late. Avail yourselves of My mercy now before you stand before Me as the just judge. My mercy is for all the living. No matter, how much evil you have done in your lives, it is not too late while you live on this earth. Once you pass from this life, your choice will have already been made. This is why My lost children, you must choose for Me now. There is much good we will do together, but first you must turn your back on your sins and walk toward Me, the light, the lover of your soul. I redeemed you at a great price, all for the love of your soul. Do not waste My love, but accept it and draw close to Me. Then, you will know peace. Now you know chaos, confusion and unrest. With Me, you will know order, clarity, peace and calm. You will feel really, truly alive, just as in your youth. Trust in My mercy. All will be well, but let us begin right away.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, you are thinking that because many know of St. Faustina’s diary that you do not need to be the ‘mouthpiece’ of My mercy beyond your daily encounters. This would be true, My child if the world really did know, but sadly they do not. Some are aware, yes. But many are still ignorant of the Gospel. You and all of My Children of Light must be My spokesperson. Live mercy, yes. This is of the utmost importance. But, I ask that you and all who follow Me, speak of My mercy. Be like the few loaves of bread and the fish that I multiplied. I do not need large crowds of people to make My message heard and spread. I need the few willing to be used and multiplied. But, I need each one of you. Do not turn away from this request, My Children of Light. This is a gift I give you, to be apostles of My mercy. If you do not know how to begin, ask Me to guide You. I am guiding and directing My children as in the days of the early Church. Yes, My little lamb, you heard Me correctly. I am pouring out My Spirit in powerful ways to bring many souls into the family of God. All that is needed are open and willing hearts. I will pour out gifts of My Spirit to give each one what is needed for the unique mission of each and every soul. Ask and pray for My Spirit to be given in new and powerful ways to bring about My Kingdom. You must be gifted for this work if you are to truly serve Me, My children for you are among the wolves. My protection is needed not only for your well being and security, but so that you can move out in the world among the wolves and bring My mercy, healing and love to those living in darkness. Yes, My children it is like the days of the early newborn Church. Consider that most people living in your times do not know God, do not love God, and do not believe in God. Consider that it is your mission to spread the Gospel to the ends of the earth. What will you do? Will you be like My first disciples and spread the message of love? Or, will you be like those who turned and walked away, too uncomfortable at the living Bread from Heaven? My Children of Light, you feel you have already chosen Me and you have but from this day forward now, you must make another choice, to share My love with the world in darkness. Do not say, ‘My family knows God, and my friends do also. We are fine and we will stick to ourselves.’ This is not love, My children. Did I not tell you in Holy Scripture that it is not enough to love your friends? Even the pagans do that. You must love your enemies. Love your enemies. Think of this. Who are your enemies? Are they not those who do not believe? Are they not those who are filled with anger and hate? Are they not those who have faith in pagan, false gods? I ask each one of you, ‘Who are your enemies?’ Visualize them, My little ones. Picture them in your mind. Then, see that I am standing near them also. I am concerned for these lost and confused souls. I died for them, also. They may be difficult now, but you should see what I see. I see how on fire with My love they could be. I see their hearts full of sorrow for their sins. I see the love they could have in their hearts, the many others they could impact if they knew Me. I see their wounds, their pain, the people in their lives who hurt them, often seriously wounded them. I see who they once were when they were little children, before they knew the corruption of sin and evil. I see them this way, My Children of Light, if you show them My love. If you pray and sacrifice for them. If you show them My mercy. If you give them My love. Yes, My little, brave souls. Their salvation depends on My act on Calvary, but it is to you I rely upon to tell them for they do not know. You are those I am calling. It is on you I rely. Think about it, please. Who else is there to send?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, Jesus I hadn’t really thought about it this way. Of course, You are relying on us. Thank You, that You are. You could do all of this Yourself, but You never planned it that way. You chose 12 Apostles and countless disciples to spread the Gospel and build Your Church.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes, My child and it is just like in those days. There are more pagans than Christians and My holy ones are now the remnant Church. You are the remnant. It has already come to pass, and soon it will be more evident. Do not wait until the numbers are even fewer. There is much wok to do, and we must begin now. There are small pockets of Spirit filled youth and older wiser ones. There are beautiful movements of My Spirit within the Church. It is time to take this Spirit of Mine out to more and more for the good of souls.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“The New Springtime will come, My child, but there is work to do first. My little lamb, it is wintertime in the history of man. You know when winter is upon you that spring will come. However, when it snows, people must still plow the snow. You put out bird seed during the stark winter to feed My little birds. You wear heavy coats to keep warm and cover your beds with more blankets. You do all of this even though you know spring is coming for you cannot sit around idle until then. Neither can My children remain idle in spreading Christianity during this winter time of souls. You must show others the path of life, the path of truth and of love. You must prepare the way by your loving acts of kindness. You must give teaching and direction, just as in times of weather emergencies. It is no different in the spiritual world. Look around you and see the great need, My children. It is time to act for Me and for My Kingdom. It is time to act for love of neighbor. Make those who are enemies into friends by bringing them to the light. Awaken from your sleep and see there is much work to do for your Jesus. Remember, you are not alone. I am with you. Together, we will save souls. Let us begin, My Children of Light. Ask Me to show you what it is you can do. Pray for direction and it will be yours. Do not be inactive in this great time of need. Ask Me for graces and graces will be yours. Frequent the Sacraments and you will receive all that you need. I am relying upon you, My children. Souls are waiting to hear this Good News that is Jesus. Thank you, My little lamb for giving Me your will. Do not listen to the lies of the enemy who wants to condemn you. You belong to Me and I to you. No harm can come to your soul. Rejoice and be full of joy because I love you. This is true of all of My children. I love you!”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Jesus. Praise You, Lord. Help me to do all that You ask.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“I bless you now in My Father’s name, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit. Go in My peace. Be love. Be mercy. Be joy.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Amen. Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;October 14, 2018 Adoration Chapel&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hello dearest Jesus, present in the Blessed Sacrament. It is so good to be here with You. I need this time with You, Lord. The world has gone crazy, Jesus. Not the entire world, of course but You know what I mean! There don’t seem to be many sacred spaces (other than here in Your chapels), Lord. What I used to think were places relatively safe from false ideologies where one could be free to learn and worship in safety, seem to have vanished. They now are home to people who have infiltrated our Catholic environments. They twist young, vulnerable minds and hearts with their evil thoughts, so sinister that they poison with sweetness. Their chocolates are laced with arsenic and they convince vulnerable people at the age of such passion for truth and liberty of goodness in evil and being tolerant of sin and lewd conduct. Lord, You were intolerant of sin, but loved the sinner. Young people are being taught to love the sinner in their sin and to accept them as they are with no call or invitation to change to recognize the need for change, for wholeness is branded as being full of hate. Oh, Jesus, You forgave the sinner and said, ‘Go and sin no more.’ This is considered ‘hate speech’ in our culture. I know it is the opposite, Jesus. Lord, this is no longer just me in the secular society, but secular society has taken over our Catholic universities and seminaries. There are few places young people can be educated these days and be free from brainwashing. Lord, God help us. Save us from ourselves, Jesus. Rescue us, Lord. Our shepherds are either part of the problem or are afraid or too timid to speak out. The ones who do speak out have little authority to affect change. Jesus, what are we to do besides pray and fast? I know prayer is powerful and fasting makes prayer even more so, but Jesus what else should we do? Thank You for blessings we have, Lord. I am grateful we still have Mass, Jesus and the Sacraments. Please protect Your holy priest sons and religious. Thank You for those shepherds who are still faithful to You and to Your people.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, My child, did I not tell you it would be this way? I have told you of this time and what is to come will be worse if My children do not pray more and frequent the Sacraments. So many of My children worship Me and acknowledge Me once a week but do not live as Christians during the week. They pay Me lip service, and think about living for Me, but proceed with their lives of entertainment and pursuit of material things. They do not live the Gospel message. They do not live as followers of Christ. They blend in to the world and the culture so much so that the world cannot see that they are Christians. This is why, My little lamb, the culture has taken over the Church. The Church is called to holiness, to be a witness to the world and to change the culture. My child, I know your heart is sick and you are very discouraged. You cannot feel otherwise when you are a true follower of Jesus. Therefore, continue to spread My light. Seek My face and be filled with My peace and My mercy. Your job is to love and follow Me. I will work through you where you are; wherever you are just as I put your family in the right place and time yesterday to assist another brother. Walk in My light, My little lamb. Do you not see My hand in all things? Yes, I know that you do, but I remind you of this. I know every hair on your head. I know exactly where you are at all times, for I go with you. I know this about each and every one of My children. There is no hiding from Me.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“To My children living in evil, listen well. I know each and every evil deed committed and every lie taught to My children. You will pay a very dear price for leading My little sheep astray. So much so, that you will one day wish you had never been born. Repent, I say. The day of the Lord is coming like a thief in the night and you do not know when. Therefore, repent now I say. There is very little time for you. This country has been given a reprieve and only God the Father knows how long this reprieve will be.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“As for you, My little lamb, help your brothers and sisters. Do what little you can and I will do the rest. Pray and continue to be open to My Holy Spirit. Those who cooperate with God now will be used in a mighty and powerful way for such is this time of grace. I have given you powerful weapons in the prayer of the Rosary and the Divine Mercy Chaplet. Pray these often now, My child. Speak with Me throughout your day. I will guide you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Jesus! I know You are with me and I am grateful!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“Share all that is going on in your life, My (name withheld). I am here to help and to give you guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Jesus. Please go before us today and give us peaceful and loving hearts, even in the midst of such evil. That will be miraculous, Lord when I feel so much restlessness and concern. Sometimes I want to remain in the safety and security of my home, but I know that even there it is not safe. The world will encroach on even our homes if we don’t stand against the tide of the culture of evil and death. Help me, Lord when I am at work and I have to see the agenda of evil presented as good. Help me, Jesus when I go to the university and see the victimization of family life, marriage and holiness, presented as evil. Jesus, this is the age of lies and wickedness. Truly it is as You said, worse than in the days of Noah. Lord, save us. Protect our children and grandchildren. Please, Jesus it is enough and only You can save us.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, do as I have said. Remain close to Me. I will go with you into the world where I will touch hearts through you. You must not hide your light, the light of Christ, under a basket, but put it on a stand for all to see. If you are persecuted, it will not matter. I was persecuted, too. This world needs more brave souls standing for Christ, your Savior. You were correct in what you told My little (name withheld); ‘It is time we took back our Church’.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;I am sorry I was so bold, Jesus as if we can do this.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“You were correct, My little lamb; it is time. It is past time, but still it is time now. I work through My children. You all must stand for Me while there are still people standing. There is little time My (name withheld). Be filled with hope, though for all is happening according to My plan, the Will of God! Do not fear. There is nothing to fear when I am with you. Wear blessed objects, use holy water blessed by a priest. Carry Me in your hearts and be of good cheer. Remain humble and merciful. Rely on your Jesus. The evil one hates the humble of heart. He cannot harm you when you are marked with holy water and sealed by Me. This is My Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Jesus I believe what You say, but it sure appears otherwise. I can see why Pope Benedict said the Church will be smaller but holier. I can see the smaller part and I’m sure with more purification we will be holier. Jesus, I think about the words of our first Pope, St. Peter, when he said to You, ‘Lord, to whom shall we go, You have the words of eternal life.’ There is no other place to go, and I will remain in Your Church, the one, true Catholic and Apostolic Church. Jesus, please return the Church to the holiness You intended. I know there have always been Judases, but please purge them from the many positions of power they have, the many places of authority. Expose them, Lord, then route them from our midst. May they repent and change their ways, Lord. Make us all holy, Lord through Your grace. Use us wherever we are needed, Lord. My family will serve You, Lord. Praise You for all You are, the Lord, God, King of Heaven and Earth. Jesus, there are six young people in Adoration! Now my heart is filled with hope. This is a sweet sign, Lord that You are alive in the hearts of young people. Jesus, renew the faith in our young people. Thank You, my Lord. Blessed Mother, Queen and Mother of the Church raise holy young people to lead our Church. Teach us, good and holy Mother. Help us to protect our children as you and St. Joseph protected Jesus when you fled to Egypt to avoid the slaughter of Herod.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Blessed Mother speaks: “My daughter, God will guide all who listen to His voice. Open hearts, willing spirits, obedient children hear God the Father’s voice, hear My Son’s voice and will be moved by My Spouse, the Holy Spirit. Just as St. Joseph heard in a dream the angel guiding him to take us and flee to Egypt, so will it be in these days for those who pray and live God’s commandments. Those who have love in their hearts and try to live holy lives will know and hear My Son’s voice. He is always guiding and directing, for He is the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for His sheep. It is only a matter of being in a state of grace to recognize His voice. Do not despair, nor be discouraged, but instead trust. God will provide an answer to every difficulty. What is needed is trust. Praise God for all He is and for all He has done for humanity. He is to be praised, in every circumstance. When you praise Him, you join your praises to those of the angels and saints. You become united with the inhabitants of Heaven who are your brothers and sisters. Be people of hope for your hope is in God. Keep your eyes on Heaven, My child. Heaven must be in your line of sight at all times. That is the way to deal with reality, by focusing on the reality of Heaven. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Let My Son’s words always be in your heart and on your lips. These words will be a consolation to you as well as a plea to the Father. These are God the Son’s words and they hold power, the power and love of My Son. My child, I am the Mother of the Church, for My Son put me in this place, and I intercede for His Church. I will, and I am protecting it. You know that this entire state of affairs was prophesied, and you are living to see it. My children did not heed the warnings given to them at Fatima and they have not listened to Me in the countless other places God sent Me to appear. Sadly, this is the result. It is not only the priests and Bishops who have sinned, who are to blame, but also the laity for many, many have brought this about by sinfulness and lack of repentance. My Son has not done this, as some think. He has preserved His Church in spite of mankind’s wretchedness, out of His Infinite Mercy. Yet, mankind’s repentance and return to holiness will bring about the renewal that Holy St. Pope John Paul II, My son spoke of many years ago. My Immaculate Heart will triumph. For now, you and My other little ones are called to pray and make sacrifices of penance for the many sins that offend God. I will bless you with My Motherly blessing and send graces to you for love, holiness, and courage. I will protect My children under my Motherly Mantle so do not fear. Your Mother is beside you. Jesus is with you. His Holy Spirit is with the Church. Remember, there are many more good and holy priests and Bishops than there are sinful ones. Support and encourage them. Pray for them. They are your brothers. Love them. They need your support and your prayers now more than ever to stand against the tide of evil that wants to overtake the Church that My Son died for, so pray much, love much, forgive much. Another, like the one you love, will be raised to lead the Church. My Son Wills it. Be love, and be like My Son.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Blessed Mother. It’s been too long since we’ve talked and Your beautiful, motherly words are like music to my soul. Thank You! Jesus, thank You for Your Mother. Where would we be without Her? Praise You, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“Do you feel better now, My little lamb?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Jesus. I have peace restored to my heart.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“She has that affect on Her children.” (smiling)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Lord!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“You are welcome, My child. Go in peace now. I will be with you in the meeting with your family this afternoon. All will be well. Trust your loved ones to Me, My child. Give them to Me.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Jesus. Thank You, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“Go now in My peace and in My love. Be mercy to all you meet. I bless you in My Father’s name, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit. All will be well.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Lord. Amen! Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;October 7, 2018 Adoration Chapel&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hello, Jesus always present in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar. It is very good to be here with You. Thank You for this great opportunity to sit with You and visit face to face, Jesus. Praise You, my Lord, my God and my King. There is much peace when I am in Your presence, Jesus. The silence and Your presence console me. I bring every burden and concern to You and lay them at the foot of Your holy cross. Take them, Lord. I trust You with each one. I trust You with each friend and family member.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lord, please help (name withheld). She is so ill (condition withheld). Jesus, heal her. Help her, Jesus to be well and whole. Lord, if You do not heal her I’m afraid she will die and at such a young age. Her children and her husband need her. The world needs her. You know all of this, Lord. You know everything. Please heal her if it is Your Holy Will. Jesus, be with all who are ill. Give them graces for healing and draw them ever closer to Your Sacred Heart. Lord, please heal (names withheld) and all who are in need of healing. I pray for those who are away from the Church, especially for (names withheld) and all fallen away Catholics. Please bring those who are outside of the Church into the Church, for (names withheld). Strengthen us all, Jesus during these most difficult times. Help us to continue to grow closer to You, Lord. Please guard and protect all priests, Bishops, religious and the Holy Father from every evil. Surround them with holy and wise friends and advisors. Root out all that is evil and all who undermine the Church and her people. Purify Your Church, Lord and bring about the New Springtime. May Your Kingdom come on Earth as it is in Heaven and may we love as if we were living there now, Lord. Give us willing hearts, clear minds and able bodies to serve You as You desire, Jesus. Lord, I pray for the men on the Cursillo retreat. Bless them with many graces, and also their families who sacrificed for them to be on retreat all weekend. Help them to go forth from the retreat living out the Gospel message and being a light in their environments. Set the world on fire with Your Holy Spirit and renew the face of the Earth. Lord, You know my special intention for (name withheld). Please help her to live out Your Will for her life. Jesus, I trust in You. Jesus, I trust in You. Jesus, I trust in You. Help me to trust You even more, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My little lamb, you are becoming more aware of the current darkness and the clouds that cover My Church due to the sins that have consumed the souls of some of My sons. I know how you feel, My child. Many of My Children of Light suffer during the agony in the garden of this day. My Children of Light, I remind you that you are the Church Militant. You are in the midst of a great battle for souls and you must be My Soldiers of Light. You are in My Holy Mother Mary’s army. I remind you during this month of the Most Holy Rosary to pray as never before for My Church, for souls and for the coming of the Holy Spirit. I ask for a great tsunami of prayer now, at this time. May your prayers storm Heaven so that graces may rain down upon you and that you will once again be the salt of the earth. My children, the Will of God is that you will become holy and pure now, in this current age and now while you are alive. It is God’s plan for His children that you live holy lives so that you will be an example of prayer, holiness, love and peace to all you encounter. Since there are many souls in peril and there is much darkness on account of sin, you are being called to the front lines to be defenders of the faith, teachers, servants and friends to those in darkness and in the shadows of death itself. Through prayer, sacrifices, fasting and frequenting the Sacraments, I will anoint you with special graces for these days. You are marked by My Seal. You are called to be My disciples. It is for this reason, due to My love, that you have been baptized into My Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, the one true Church, so that by your life your witness, your service, you will rescue souls. I am counting on you, My Children of Light, to bear My Light, My love, My peace to a world in darkness. I will help you, My children, but you must be willing to accept My call, My invitation. Give me your ‘yes’ dearest children. I have no others to count on, no others waiting in the wings, so to speak. It is to you, I look with anticipation. Will you accept? Examine your hearts, My little ones. What is holding you back? Does something separate you from Me? What is in your life, or in your heart creating an obstacle to My Will. Let us examine this, and remove it at once, so that you are free to join My Mother’s army to usher in the Era of Peace, the New Springtime. Do not be afraid for I am gentle and merciful. I will give you every grace for this mission. So much so, that it will not seem to be as difficult as you may think it will be. Come, My children. Be confident in My love for you. Trust in Me and you will not be disappointed. Decide for God’s Will, My Children of Light. There is no time now, no room for those who are lukewarm to remain so. You are either for Me or against Me.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jesus, I love You and I want to do Your Will. Help me, Lord each and every moment to live within Your Will. Enfold me in Your Sacred Heart, Jesus so that I will never stray from You. Lord, I am weak and I often fail to please You, but You know my heart. You know that I desire to please You. I want to be well disposed to accept every grace You have to offer. Give me whatever I need to always remain faithful to You, my dearest friend. Forgive me for my sins, Jesus and please don’t allow me to fall again. That is not possible for me, Jesus but with Your grace and by Your power all things are possible.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lord, I am so happy that (name withheld) has recovered enough to return to Adoration. Praise You, Jesus! Thank You, my Lord. You are so good to restore our friend to health. How wonderful that both (names withheld) are here! Thank You!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My little one, I hear each prayer, each praise and every grateful prayer of thanksgiving. You are welcome. Your gratitude pleases Me. Your joyfulness for love of God and your fellow man consoles Me. Your heart is good, My child, so much like your Grandmother’s, and your Mother’s hearts. They pray for you. They love you. They offer little waves of encouragement and ask Me for graces for you and for each sibling and each grandchild and great grandchild. Do not think for one moment that your family in Heaven forgets you for it is to the contrary. Their hearts and minds are much more closely united with those remaining on Earth. Rejoice when you have so many holy family members who have come to join Me in My heavenly kingdom. Be grateful and be filled with joy. You come from a long line of faithful followers of your Jesus.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, thank You, my Lord for this great gift. I am filled with joy and gratitude. I have no words to express my appreciation for Your gift of salvation. Jesus, thank You for shedding Your holy, precious blood on the cross. Thank You for the salvific act that saves us and enables us to live with You forever and also with our family and friends. What great love You have. Jesus, give me some of this great love. Increase the love in my heart for others, Jesus especially for those who may be more difficult to love. Help me to see You in them, Lord. Help me to see what You see in others. Give me eyes of faith, Lord. Give me graces to love heroically, Lord so that I can be a conduit for Your love. Only You can make it so. Jesus, have You anymore to say to me?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes, My child. Be aware of My presence with you. My Spirit desires unity with you. Continue growing closer to Me, My little lamb even while you are at work, or studying or serving others. Know that I am with you. Really know this by opening your heart more and more to My presence! You do not need to know how to do this, little one, only be accepting and open. Respond to the promptings I send to you just as you did today when you sensed (name withheld) was in need. You turned to see what she needed and then acted right away. You did the same when you welcomed (name withheld). Your joy at seeing him gave him encouragement and made him aware that he still has value and dignity. I love My friends who have lived long lives and have remained faithful for decades, despite hardships, sorrow, loss and pain. They withstand all of life’s tests and crosses and bring Me great joy. You are correct to honor them and treat them with love and joy. Your patience is a sure sign of My presence within and this is good, My daughter. Be confident in My love. You are My daughter. Do you realize the greatness of your position? You are a daughter of God, you are a daughter of the King of Heaven and Earth. Reflect on this, My child. I desire all of My children to realize what it means to be a daughter and son of God, the Most High King. All of you are princes and princesses and you must behave in such a way that shows the world that you are holy and that in spite of this great dignity, because of this great dignity that you are also humble, for I chose you; I created you all from nothing. This is My desire for you, to be like Me. Be love, be joy, be holy and pure, be faithful to God and be merciful. I desire all of My children to join Me in Heaven one day and so you must pray more and ask for the graces needed each day to work with Me and save souls. Ask each day for needed graces, My children for each day requires specific graces for the tasks at hand. Each day is unique and so requires specific, unique graces to equip you for the people you will encounter and the work I will ask you to do. Remember, you are not alone in this work. I will send others to assist you and if there are no others, I will send the angels to tend to each and every need. Remember to ask the saints in Heaven to pray for you. You have everything necessary to succeed. My Church has the Sacraments, My Word, My Apostles to guide and teach you. You, My children be the balm on the wounds of My body, the Church. Be full of hope. My Mother guides you. You are in the best of hands, the hands of the Immaculate One, My Mother and your Mother, the Queen of the Church. All will be well. I am with you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Go now in My peace, My beloved. I bless you in My Father’s name, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit. I go with you, My child. Be of good cheer.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank YOU, Jesus. I love You!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“And I love you!”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;September 30, 2018 Adoration Chapel&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hello, my Jesus ever present in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar. I believe in, hope in, love and adore You, my God and my King. Thank You for the opportunity to be here with You, Jesus. Thank You for Holy Mass this morning and for our family. Please heal those who are sick, Lord especially (names withheld). Heal those who have emotional wounds, too, Jesus. Lord, I pray for all mothers and fathers that You will draw them close to You and help them to desire holiness and goodness. Give them graces to raise their children in the ways of the Lord. Help those considering abortion to choose life for their babies. Give them graces to love and to trust in You. Jesus, be with all who have died, especially (name withheld). Take her soul to Heaven, Jesus. Lord, please be with those who have lost loved ones, including (names withheld) and all who have lost spouses and children. Take the souls of their loved ones into Heaven. I pray this for all of my relatives. Lord, be with us as we begin another week. Remain with us and never leave us. Thank You for protecting us on the way here and keeping us from harm.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, My child, it is My Will that you are here with Me in this time and in this place. My plans are not always evident to you, but are woven into each moment of your life. Allow every moment to be an offering to the Father in union with My life. Even the most mundane moments, My little ones, can be times of closeness with Heaven. When you feel alone, remember you are not alone. I am with you. Your angel guardian and other angels I assign to you are near and all around you. Padre Pio watches over you as does your patron saint, Saint Elizabeth. You do not know this by way of your senses at this time but you believe and are aware because of faith. My little lamb, I keep these beautiful graces and the presence of heavenlies hidden from you in order to merit more graces because of your faith. Do not be discouraged when you feel alone, but rejoice in this cross that I allow for you. Instead, draw even closer to Me and to My Most Holy Mother Mary, and your Mother. Be aware, by faith of the presence of God and the holy court of angels and saints. One day you will look with wonder on all that I show you; all that remains hidden to you because of My Will. Recall, My child, the promise given to you that you will see your earthly mother, who is with Me in Heaven. Rejoice My child, that you are not alone, but instead enjoy a holy company.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Thank You, Lord. I will try to remember this great grace. I thank You for the cross of loneliness, Jesus. I also thank You for the beautiful friends You have given me and that you place on my path at just the time I am feeling very low. You sent (name withheld) to me last week, Lord and another person is working in my building that I knew from a past job. They comfort me, Jesus. It’s good to see some familiar faces, Lord. Help me to take your light to all I meet. Help me to be a grace to others. Allow Your love, light, life, peace and joy to flow through me, Jesus even when I am lacking in these myself. Give them to others through me. May Your graces make others feel light as a breeze, Jesus. Help them to connect with Your love. Give me graces to love heroically, and to be full of joy for You. I love You, Jesus. Help me to love You more. Help me with my studies, Lord and with the stress I take upon myself when there isn’t enough time in the day to complete all that is in front of me. I give all burdens, deadlines, projects, concerns to You, Lord Jesus. Thank You for protecting me last night, Lord when I was under attack. Your name is very powerful, Lord and causes the demons to flee. Praise the Holy Name of Jesus! Praise Your Most Precious Blood. Thank You, Blessed Mother Mary, Most Holy. Thank You for coming to My assistance. You have never failed to help me, Mother. I love You. I am grateful to You for my life.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“You are welcome, My child. Always call on My Son’s name. Use it often when you are in distress or in need of any kind. His name is above all names. It will give you strength and peace.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Blessed Mother. Thank You!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“You are welcome, dear child. Know also that I am a good mother and I will not abandon My children. Call on Me, and I will come to your aid. You have nothing to fear with Jesus and your angel close by, and I will be with you when you call. See, what is there to be anxious about? Nothing, I tell you for the Lord, My Son has seen to everything, long before you were even born, My daughter. So, be filled with joy, no matter the circumstance.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, my Queen, my Mother, I love You! Thank You, Jesus for sharing Your Mother with us! You withhold nothing. You are most generous, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My little lamb, I share every good thing with My children and will share even more in time. You will see. My child and all My Children of Light you are to imitate Me and share what you have with those who are in need. Everything you have comes from the Father and therefore show Him your gratitude by giving also to those around you, who are less fortunate materially. Be kind and generous. If you do not have money to share, share your time, your food, your kindness. There is always something you have that can be shared. Love one another as I love you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My children, do not be fooled by the way the world seems at this moment. Things may look good on the surface, My children and so you become complacent. Do not return to your former ways. Pray as I have asked you to pray. Read Scripture, frequent the Sacraments, fortify yourself with Holy Communion, My body, blood, soul and divinity. Why do you stay away from Me through the week when I await you in your churches and in the tabernacle? I have graces to pour out on the world, and will use My children to do so, but you remain in your homes, busy with your chores, or rushing to and from work, errands, school and countless places. You make time for many social events, My children, but you do not have time for your Jesus. Do not miss the opportunity for additional sacramental grace. There is much evil in the world and you need Me. Come to Me, My children and replenish that which the world robs from you. I will renew your spirits.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My child, pray especially hard this week. Continue the rosary novena to Me in honor of the archangels who serve Me so faithfully. Your intentions are heard in Heaven, child and they join the hundreds of other rosary novenas. My little lamb, your prayers and those of My children are not in vain. Through the prayers of My faithful followers, through Holy Mass and many sacrifices, evil is being held back. But the force of evil has already been given a stronghold, and in your nation the battle will only go to you if My children pray, pray, pray. There is no time for complacency. In days and centuries past, it was enough to lead a holy life and to raise your children in the light of truth and love. It requires more of you now, My children. It requires much more. My Children of Light, you are chosen by Me to be in this time in history because you take the things of faith to heart. You follow Me and know My voice, and you are given graces to see, graces to know the times. You must therefore, resolve to pray more, to sacrifice more and to frequent the Sacraments. It makes no difference how long the bridegroom is away, you must always be prepared and do not allow the oil in your lamps to be empty. Fill your soul with graces, My children by coming to Me and by receiving the Sacraments as often as possible. Bring your children to daily Mass so they will be filled with grace, also. My children, prioritize your lives by putting God in the first place. All else will take care of itself when you have your priorities in right order. Trust in Me. Do as I say. Do as My Word says. Do as My Church says. I speak through My Scripture and through My Church very clearly. Listen to Me, My children. I love you and I want all that is good for you. My Will is holy. My Will is perfect and is best for your souls. One day we will be celebrating together in My Kingdom. For now, be My witnesses, be My love. Spread the Good News, My children to bring more souls with you to Heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Jesus, thank You for Your Holy Word. Thank You for leading me to read the letter of Jude. Your Word is truly the Living Word, Jesus. Thank You, Lord. Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My little lamb, such are the times in which you live.” (Jesus says this as if sighing.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Poor, Jesus. I love You, Lord. We all love You, but I know that doesn’t console the empty places in Your heart, Jesus where Your own children are missing. Spread graces for conversion, Jesus. Spare the souls of those who are steeped in sin and evil. Only You can save them, Lord. Save them, Jesus. Save all souls.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“My little one, pray Divine Mercy chaplets for your brothers and sisters who are lost. Pray much for them, My child. You and your family pray the most holy Rosary and the Divine Mercy Chaplet. Make this a priority and I will give you the time.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Jesus. Help us, Lord to pray as You ask.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;“I know that I ask more of you, My little one. I ask because I know you will say ‘yes,’ and because of the dire need for souls. If you were watching someone fall and they were grasping a branch of the side of a mountain, you would help them, My child. This is exactly what people are doing all around you. They are hanging from branches, ready to fall. They have no strength left to hold on for they have been left hanging with no assistance, no encouragement and they are growing very weak. Your prayers will bring them hope. My (name withheld), My (name withheld), My (name withheld), My little (name withheld) if you and My other children only saw the souls in need as I see them, you would easily pray more. This goes for all of My children. Times are dire; souls are at stake. Pray, My Children of Light. It is not the time to become lax. It is the time to enter the battle of prayer and do battle for souls. Ask St. Michael to assist you. Pray, pray, pray. This is all My child. This is what I am asking and what I need now from all of My children. It is time to take up arms, and by this, I mean the weapons of the most holy Rosary and Divine Mercy Chaplet. Fortify yourselves through fasting, Mass and the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Come to the water often. I will refresh your souls. Be peace, be mercy, be love, be joy. Be filled with My Holy Spirit. I want it. I Will it. Go now in My love. I bless you in the name of My Father, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit. Be at peace and know I am with you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Amen! Alleluia! Praise be Jesus, true God and true Man!&lt;/p&gt;"},{"id":9623,"datePublished":"2019-03-03T00:00:00","nodeName":"Msg from December 2nd, 2018","pageTitle":"Message from December 2nd, 2018","subtitle":"","author":"","visionary":"Children of the Renewal","visionaryId":9538,"originalSource":"","originalSourceName":"","lstDateOfMsgs":null,"content":"&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@ Adoration Chapel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Hello dearest Jesus ever present in the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar.&#160;

Jesus, help me with each decision ahead.&#160; Thank You for always giving me clarity when I seek direction from You.&#160; Thank You for Father’s homily this morning and for the ideas You gave me earlier this morning.&#160; Father’s homily was the confirmation.&#160; Praise You, Lord!&#160; You know everything, Lord and all that You do is perfect!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, I Will to give you clarity each time you bring a decision to Me.&#160; Sometimes I set you on a different course.&#160; Thank You for being open to Me and listening.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord.&#160; It is I who thank You for all Your assistance.&#160; I am lost without You.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little one, when you feel this way, recognize I am allowing you to feel the need for My navigation.&#160; I am your captain and also your compass.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus and Our Lady Star of the Sea shines with Your reflection illuminated by the Holy Spirit.&#160; If I look to Her for guidance She shows me the way to You.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My little lamb.&#160; This is true.&#160; You will not lose your way when you look to My Mother as your Star who sheds light on the course to illuminate your path to Me.&#160; In My days on earth, we had only the light from the moon at night and our lanterns.&#160; When it was very cloudy, the light of the moon was hidden.&#160; Then it was the darkest of nights.&#160; Even our lanterns, which gave enough light for a few steps, were not as useful as on a clear night.&#160; So it is true in your day.&#160; The earth is very dark due to mankind’s sins.&#160; Though My Mother’s heart still perfectly reflects Me, man refuses to look for Her light.&#160; It is difficult to see when sin darkens the eyes of the heart.&#160; Therefore, mankind does not see My Mother and neither do they see Me.&#160; Their hearts and souls are darkened.&#160; They are unable to recognize the Son of Man and therefore unable to recognize truth.&#160; People of this time say, ‘What then is truth?’&#160; They like the words of Pilate, for they not only can’t see truth but do not believe truth exists.&#160; They do not believe in the God who made them.&#160; They do not believe in the One who is truth.&#160; This is why, even after the Illumination of Souls, some will continue to reject Me.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, why do we, people reject what is good and holy even though we know it is the only way to life everlasting?&#160; (Name withheld) had the conversation at work (as You know) that denied truth.&#160; Jesus, they (the ladies) do not believe abortion is the killing of babies.&#160; Educated people blatantly say these pre-born babies are not human.&#160; This is such a ludicrous statement, Jesus.&#160; (Name withheld) HAD NO OTHER RECOURSE but to lovingly correct them, though they would hear nothing of what she said.&#160; Jesus, it is appalling that someone who has been taught science and medicine could actually claim a baby is not human until it is born.&#160; As if coming through the birth canal magically changes something into a human being.&#160; How ridiculous and absurd.&#160; Even a child knows a baby in the womb is a baby-a human baby.&#160; It is certainly not a turtle or a monkey or a dog!&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, this is the darkening of the heart and soul which darkens the intellect.&#160; One steeped in sin and even sinful, evil philosophies cannot see truth.&#160; This is why many rejected Me even when I stood before them.&#160; God in person - in the flesh, working miracles, bringing the dead back to life - did not convince some.&#160; They refused to be open to another way.&#160; They wanted to hold onto the evil philosophies for pride was involved.&#160; Pride, the foundation of evil, leads countless souls astray for the father of lies is also the father of pride.&#160; I am truth.&#160; I am love and mercy.&#160; I am humility.&#160; I came to serve and to give My life for souls.&#160; The evil one takes souls to spite God for he hates God and all I have created.&#160; He hates human life that was made higher than the angels.&#160; His pride turned into hate for God and all God created.&#160; To follow him is to reject God and all I have created.&#160; This is the evil lie of abortion.&#160; Some believe it out of a false sense of compassion for the woman, but this too is a lie.&#160; There is no compassion in encouraging one to kill one’s offspring.&#160; (Name withheld), My little one, brought light into the darkness when she stood for Me, the truth.&#160; She did very well.&#160; You were also right in acknowledging that only I can provide healing to their eyes darkened by sin.&#160; Only I can penetrate such darkness.&#160; Still, My little child spoke with wisdom and the fire of My Holy Spirit.&#160; I am well pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, I ask You to open the eyes of their hearts.&#160; Penetrate their souls with the light of truth and give them the great gift of faith.&#160; Help them, Jesus to see You, to know You, to believe in You.&#160; Thank You for giving (name withheld) the courage to speak in Your name.&#160; Praise You Lord for all You have done and for all I believe You will do.&#160; Bring conversion, Lord to all the people in (name withheld) workplace.&#160; May Your holy fragrance pour forth from her heart and may Our Lady shower the graces of the Flame of Love on all these misguided children of Yours.&#160; Help them to know and love You, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, this is a good prayer.&#160; I hold this close to My Sacred Heart.&#160; My Heart purifies, My child.&#160; This is where I hold My children (close to My Heart) and where I hold all this is dear to Me.&#160; My child, I affirm your decision regarding school because this came from Me.&#160; I know you thought it was so but were unsure.&#160; I enlightened you that there is another way, one you had not considered.&#160; This is from Me.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, what about the trip?&#160; I have a dilemma, because I want (name withheld) to go.&#160; I don’t want to leave anyone out of receiving these amazing graces from Your Mother.&#160; I wish everyone in our family would go, from (names withheld) and all our grandchildren.&#160; Lord, it seems selfish of me to do this again when I have been so many times.&#160; Just a few weeks ago, though my heart was longing to be in (location withheld).&#160; Even in spite of how miserable I was the last time I went.&#160; I don’t want to go through that again!&#160; What should I do, Jesus?&#160; Should I put the deposit down and then wait to hear from You?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, you were saying this morning how My holy priest son is like a St. Padre Pio.&#160; He is your spiritual father.&#160; Have you asked him?&#160; You already have (name withheld) permission.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;No, Lord, I haven’t. (you know I haven’t ….)&#160; St. Padre Pio, what should I do about this?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;St. Pio: “My child, I will give you the advice I would give to anyone who asks me.&#160; Run to your Mother!&#160; I am surprised you would ask! (smiling) Whenever you have the opportunity, always choose the Blessed Mother.&#160; By this you choose the best.&#160; She is Queen of Heaven and Earth.&#160; You have been invited by the Queen to visit Her.&#160; What I want to know is, why do so many reject the invitation of&#160;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Queen?&#160; People would be foolish to reject the invitation of an earthly queen who was good and loving and holy.&#160; Why reject the invitation of Our Heavenly Queen?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;When you put it this way, St. Pio I see exactly what I should do.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;St. Pio: “Regarding everyone else?&#160; Leave them to God.&#160; Pray for them, fast for them and leave them to God.&#160; Then, they are His problems.”&#160; (He is smiling and does not mean this in a cruel way.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus: “Your desire for those you love is good, My child.&#160; It is an act of love, this desire and an act of mercy when you entrust them to Me, for I am the One who can change hearts.&#160; In this way, your trust in Me and entrusting them to Me is an act of faith and an act of mercy for only then can I truly work.&#160; Be confident in Me, My child.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus.&#160; Thank You, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, you can always invite others.&#160; Allow them to choose.&#160; This is best, for then you are not choosing for them before they have had the chance.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Ok, Jesus.&#160; I see what You mean.&#160; Even if they say ‘no’ it is their decision.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, and even the act of considering for one who does not believe can be a moment for grace.&#160; It is up to them.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord.&#160; You always give me so much to think about.&#160; Thank You for teaching me with so much patience.&#160; I love You, my adorable Jesus!&#160; Praise You, my Lord and my God.&#160; Praise You King of Heaven and Earth!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Thank you, My little lamb.&#160; I bless you in My Father’s name, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.&#160; Go in My peace.&#160; I am with you.&#160; I will help you in all of your work and your studies.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord.&#160;

I love You, Lord.&#160; Thank You for Holy Mass and Communion this morning and for being able to sit with my family at Mass.&#160; Please bring home all who are away from the faith, especially (names withheld).&#160; Lord, please prepare my heart for the upcoming pilgrimage.&#160; I seem to be finishing projects, taking classes and working right up to departure, and never really feel reverent when it’s time to leave.&#160; Help me, Lord to be more spiritually prepared.&#160; Help us all to receive the graces we need and to be open to all You want to give us, Lord.&#160; Blessed Mother, prepare me in the school of Your love.&#160;

Help us to stop this terrible atrocity.&#160; Lord, I also lift up (name withheld) to you.&#160; Help him to mend so that he is able to get around by himself.&#160; I pray this for (name withheld) also.&#160; Lord, I haven’t seen her for some time.&#160; I hope and pray that she is alright.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, I am so very sad and disappointed in our Congress for not passing the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Bill.&#160; It’s such a tragedy in our country that we permit abortion and now we are saying with the absence of a law to protect babies who survive abortion, that infanticide is legal.&#160; These crimes of murder are against Your Commandments, Jesus.&#160; Evil has become commonplace, Jesus.&#160; Please save us from ourselves, Lord Jesus.&#160; Things look very dark right now, Lord in our Church and we are in need of Your saving power.&#160; Make us holy again, Lord so that we ca be salt and light to our sinful culture.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, My child, My child, this most blatant act defying My laws and giving, even more license to murder those who by a miracle of My grace escape abortion, is intolerable.&#160; Woe to those who take the life of even one child.&#160; Souls who refuse to repent have already condemned themselves to the fires of hell.&#160; Pray for the souls of all involved in this horrific crime of the killing of My sweet, innocent little ones who are most precious to Me.&#160; Their blood cries out from the soil of your nation and I hear the cries of those robbed from the life I gave them.&#160; Wake up, children of America and see how evil and depraved you have become.&#160; Blood floods your streets and you are too blind to see it.&#160; Those who have spiritual eyes and ears, you see the blood seeping out of the ground, flowing in the streets and filling your lakes and ponds.&#160; You curse your own nation and kill your present and future generations.&#160; Millions upon millions of souls I created are being robbed of life.&#160; How many future saints died as infant martyrs instead because you desire to play satan.&#160; You are not playing at being God, but at being satan.&#160; Turn from your wicked ways now before it is too late for your souls.&#160; My Children of Light, you must fight this evil.&#160; You are not doing enough, My children.&#160; I went to the cross for you and for My little ones who are being snuffed out like tiny sparks stomped on around a campfire.&#160; These are children.&#160; These are the future generations.&#160; You not only allow them to be killed but prevent all of their offspring and future generations to be born.&#160; How wicked is this age.&#160; How rebellious and evil is this age.&#160; Stop this killing, My children of America.&#160; You are leading the entire world into this murderous crime of abortion.&#160; How many decades I have allowed pass so that you would turn back to Me and yet with more time your sinful condition grows worse.&#160; You must pray harder.&#160; You must fast.&#160; You must push back against these wicked laws that are laws against your Jesus.&#160; These are not true laws, they are licenses to commit murder.&#160; How long before I must chastise you severely?&#160; How long, My children?&#160; You must act quickly.&#160; You must act decisively to vocalize your rejection of these so-called laws.&#160; I have given you a leader who stands for life.&#160; Do not waste this opportunity, for the evil tides will wash over all of you.&#160; It is not only My little ones, but all children and the elderly will be targeted next.&#160; All who are disabled will be targeted.&#160; The goal of My adversary is to wipe out the human race.&#160; Genocide is its name.&#160; Death and destruction is his aim.&#160; He does not even need war to do this presently.&#160; He has turned mother against her children.&#160; Fathers against mothers, parents against children and grandchildren.&#160; It is worse than so many of you realize.&#160; When I look at your land, I see the blood of holy innocents and I hear their cries.&#160; Repent, My children of the U.S. for your judgement is near.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, My child, I cannot spare you these words.&#160; I cannot spare you.&#160; You are My messenger.&#160; I am warning My messengers so they can warn others.&#160; These times are dire indeed.&#160; With each obstacle to life; licenses to kill increase.&#160; There is little regard for the sacredness and dignity of life.&#160; Confusion and insanity have replaced ethics and morals.&#160; Sins against God and nature abound and are given a place of honor in your country.&#160; Sodomy is called ‘marriage,’ killing is called pro-choice, and sexual sin is called sexual liberation.&#160; Lies, lies, lies heaped upon evil intent.&#160; Children are sinned against in the most egregious ways.&#160; All of Heaven prays for the people of earth.&#160; It is well past time to act, but act now, pray much, fast and be prepared to give your lives for the faith.&#160; This evil must be defeated by My people and with the help of Heaven it will be.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“One way or another it will, but you will prefer to be part of the solution, My children, then waiting for Me to issue the final blow.&#160; I will act, but it will be late when more souls have been lost.&#160; By cooperating with Me now, many souls will be saved.&#160; Do not allow your nation to be worse than Sodom and Gomorrah.&#160; Repent and wake up now, My children.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“This is all I have to say, My little lamb.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, I am heartsick and I can hardly bear your anger.&#160; I am sure it is only a glimmer of the fullness of your righteous anger.&#160; Help us to turn back to You, Jesus.&#160; Help us, Lord.&#160; Give us the grace to fight this evil, Lord.&#160; Help each one of us to know what you want us to do.&#160; Guide us, Jesus.&#160; Direct us, each one of Your Children of Light.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, this can no longer be a ‘cause’ that calls only those who are interested.&#160; My people say, ‘I am not called to do this or that.&#160; I do not feel called.’&#160;&#160; My child, every one of My disciples is called to defend life.&#160; This is at the heart of My Gospel.&#160; Who is more oppressed than the baby in danger of abortion?&#160; Who is more persecuted, sought after, hunted than the baby in the womb?&#160; There is no better cause, no greater cause of your time than stopping abortion, than protecting the holy innocents.&#160; You all must pick up this cross and stop this holocaust now while there are still people alive.&#160; The greatest threat to mankind is the evil of abortion.&#160; The time for all of My children to take up this call to action is now.&#160; Be at peace.&#160; Do not add violence to more violence.&#160; Pray.&#160; Act with love but be firm.&#160; Speak out. &#160;Stand in prayer and show your rejection of this evil by your physical presence.&#160; Witness to the victims of abortion.&#160; Be merciful and forgiving, but also extend your love and your material assistance.&#160; Be heroic lovers of life and get involved to stop this evil of your day.&#160; Call on My Mother to help you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, that is all for now.&#160; Be at peace.&#160; Be merciful.&#160; Be love.&#160; Show others your love and your mercy.&#160; Give them Me, your Jesus.&#160; I bless you in the name of My Father, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.&#160; Go now in peace.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;​F&lt;span&gt;ebruary 24, 2019&#160;

Thank You for Holy Mass this morning and for Holy Communion.&#160; Jesus, the woman in front of me was crying.&#160; Please comfort and console her.&#160; I’m glad to see that her husband was attentive and caring.&#160; Thank You, Lord.&#160; Please bring healing to her heart, Jesus.&#160; Lord, I was surprised to hear about (name withheld) husband.&#160; I don’t know (nor do I need to know) why he left her or what is going on.&#160; Please bring healing to their marriage.&#160; Help the confusion and doubt that he is going through to be cleared away so he can see that he should be faithful to his marriage vows.&#160; Help (name withheld) to forgive and to be courageous.&#160; Protect and care for her, Lord.&#160; Jesus, I miss (name withheld) and wish he could return to our church.&#160; Help him, Jesus.&#160; Heal him.&#160; Restore his health so that he is able to fully serve You in his priestly ministry.&#160; Lord, bless his suffering and use it for the good of Your Church and Your Kingdom.&#160; Help all who are ill, Lord especially those who are spiritually ill and those who do not know Your love.&#160; Bring all souls to You, Lord so that one day all will be in Your heavenly kingdom.&#160; Jesus, I trust in You.&#160; Jesus, I trust in You. &#160;Jesus, I trust in You!&#160; Lord, pour out Your mercy on the whole world during this 3:00 pm hour of mercy.&#160; Bring healing to our nation and the whole world.&#160; Reunite our country to You, Jesus so that we are once again One Nation Under God.&#160; Help us, Jesus.&#160; Heal us, Jesus.&#160; Give us graces for conversion, repentance, mercy and love.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, My child, I have oceans of mercy for all, but souls do not avail themselves of My mercy.&#160; It is there for everyone who asks.&#160; Come to My Merciful Heart, My children.&#160; Do not be afraid to approach the throne of mercy.&#160; My mercy is for you.&#160; It is for each soul.&#160; It is for the hardest of sinners.&#160; No sin is too evil for Me to forgive; I can do all things.&#160; I can do everything.&#160; I have the power to forgive sins because I am the Sinless One.&#160; I triumphed over sin.&#160; Bring all to Me, My children and do not fear.&#160; You have nothing to fear.&#160; I have the power to forgive and to restore your soul to grace.&#160; You may be thinking, ‘Yes, You have the power, Lord but I am too unworthy.’&#160; Nay, I tell you.&#160; My mercy is for you.&#160; My mercy is for the very worst of all sinners.&#160; You, who are the worst have the front seat at My banquet and we will especially celebrate your return to the Family of God.&#160; There is enough mercy for all, so do not hold back but come to Me.&#160; Come quickly, My child.&#160; It is enough for you to say, ‘What must we do, Jesus?&#160; What must I do to be restored to grace?’&#160; To which I will reply, go to the priest.&#160; You need to hear his fatherly words, confess your sins with a contrite heart, and listen to the words of absolution.&#160; This is My Mercy.&#160; This is the Sacrament of Mercy.&#160; Allow yourselves to be immersed in My Mercy and then receive the Sacrament of Holy Communion, the sacrifice of My love for you.&#160; My children, you receive mercy from your Jesus and I ask that you go out into the world and give My mercy to all you meet.&#160; Be merciful.&#160; Be love.&#160; Share My love with others.&#160; There is much darkness in the world.&#160; There is much evil.&#160; Love will prevail.&#160; Love triumphs over evil.&#160; So, you must bring My love to all you meet.&#160; Does this sound repetitious, Children of the Light?&#160; If so, ask yourselves why parents must repeat themselves to their children.&#160; I have much more to say, more to teach you, but you must have a firm foundation rooted in the Church and the Sacred Scripture.&#160; You must have prayer.&#160; From these, you are to take My love to the world.&#160; This is the essence of all I taught.&#160; It is essential.&#160; Begin to live the Gospel, My children.&#160; Be glad that the Father loves you so, for truly, truly He loves you.&#160; Yes!&#160; He loves you!&#160; This is a personal and an intimate love at the individual level.&#160; Reflect on this and rejoice.&#160; Return God’s love to Him.&#160; Receive His love for you.&#160; It is in this receiving and giving of God’s love that you will dwell in the Kingdom.&#160; He will bring about His Kingdom on earth as in Heaven when His children receive and give God’s love to others.&#160; Be magnanimous, just as God is magnanimous.&#160; Freely give His love, as He freely gives His love to each of you.&#160; Be forgiving.&#160; Forgive quickly and often, My children.&#160; Do not hold grudges but forgive instantly.&#160; I know many of you have been deeply wounded.&#160; Many of you have every reason to be wounded.&#160; Many of you have every reason to be angry.&#160; Be angry with the sin committed against you, as I am, but have mercy on the one who sinned.&#160; Pray for your enemies and pray for loved ones who have hurt you.&#160; Often these wounds are the deepest.&#160; Give all wounds to Me.&#160; Ask for My healing.&#160; Ask My Holy Mother Mary to pray for you.&#160; Ask Her to pray for the ones who have hurt you.&#160; Love heroically, My children.&#160; It will be possible with My assistance.&#160; Do not be afraid to love and forgive.&#160; Fear only unforgiveness and pride.&#160; Go far from these, My children, for these things poison the soul.&#160; Free yourselves of the poison of unforgiveness and pride.&#160; Bring all to My Sacrament of Reconciliation and be reconciled with God and one another.&#160; Be holy as I am holy.&#160; I have given you the means to do so through the sacramental life of the Church.&#160; Draw close to My heart, My beloved children.&#160; It is time.&#160; Draw close to your Savior.&#160; I love you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, sweet Jesus.&#160; I love You.&#160; So many of Your children love You.&#160; Jesus, please purify Your Church quickly.&#160; Bring us through these dark days soon, Lord.&#160; Help us to heal so we can live in the light of Your love rather than the dark clouds that hover over us like a shroud.&#160; Lord, protect all children and young adults from abuse.&#160; Renew our strength, console us, heal us and bring about the outpouring of Your Holy Spirit.&#160; Renew the face of the earth, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, you have sensed the somber tone in Heaven for some time.&#160; You do not understand this, I know, My child.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, I do not understand when all I’ve ever heard and read in Scripture speaks of the joy in Heaven.&#160; There are no tears there.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My child, it is true.&#160; There is fulness of joy in Heaven.&#160; The souls in Heaven are filled with joy at being in the presence of God, the angels, their family members and friends.&#160; Their joy is complete.&#160; Still, they are able to love those on earth.&#160; They look joyfully ahead to the time when loved ones will complete their earthly journey and come to Heaven.&#160; They are also aware of the perils souls face and they pray earnestly for those on earth.&#160; This does not diminish their joy.&#160; They have an increased capacity for joy, and also their love has been perfected.&#160; One who loves does not rejoice in another’s demise and so they, fully understanding the serious times you are in, pray fervently for souls who stand at the brink of despair and darkness.&#160; They pray fervently for their brothers and sisters of Light to fortify you with My grace and the virtues that you will be courageous disciples.&#160; This fervor is very serious, My child and this is what you sense.&#160; One who is serious and fervent, can also be filled with the joy of the Lord.&#160; It does not seem possible to you, for this is not so on earth.&#160; In Heaven all is complete.&#160; It is different than what you experience on earth, in many ways. &#160;It is fullness, completion, and love overflowing.&#160; It is beauty, joy and wonder.&#160; It is the fullness of understanding one another and the Will of God.&#160; Those in Heaven see with spiritual eyes and in this way, they see much more than is possible on earth. &#160;At times, I allow souls on earth to have a glimpse of these spiritual senses, but this is only a glimpse at what souls’ gaze upon in Heaven.&#160; What is veiled on earth is constantly before the souls in Heaven.&#160; Do you understand, My child?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;I understand what You mean, Lord but not in the way I want to because I have not experienced this.&#160; It is like reading about a foreign country that I have never visited.&#160; There is a limited understanding from what was read, but one who visits the country, stays for years, gets to know the people, the language and customs really and fully understands.&#160; Until then, it is simply words on a page and we are left of our own imagination within the boundaries of what Scripture tells us, ‘Eye has not seen, ear has not heard, what God has ready for those who love Him.&#160; Spirit of God come give us the mind of Jesus.&#160; Teach us the wisdom of love.’&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My little lamb.&#160; This bring us back to the beginning of My message.&#160; Love.&#160; So, you see, that is the essence.&#160; Love, mercy and forgiveness flow out from this love that is the love of God.&#160; When you have My love and you give it away to others (&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;all&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;others including those who injure you) you are living out the Gospel and working to bring about God’s Kingdom of Love.&#160; One day, My love will fill the earth.&#160; All will know and will walk in My love.&#160; That will be the Time of the Renewal, My child.&#160; Until then, pray for souls, do penance and make sacrifices for them out of love, be mercy, peace, joy and love.&#160; Pray more, My children.&#160; Lent is a very good time to draw near to My suffering heart as I prepared for My passion.&#160; Enter into this time of pray deeply.&#160; I am very near.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, please heal marriages, heal all who are wounded due to lack of love.&#160; Help the children of this generation to know, love and serve You.&#160; Jesus, help us in the quest to end abortion and euthanasia.&#160; Bring us out of this culture of death and into the culture of life, Your Kingdom.&#160; Bless and protect holy priests, Lord and fill them with heroic graces to be shepherds to Your lost sheep.&#160; Thank You for Your love and Your guidance, Jesus.&#160; Praise You and thank You for our blessings.&#160; I love You, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“And I love you!&#160; I love all of My children and long to be loved in return.&#160; My little lamb, I bless you in the name of My Father, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.&#160; Go in peace and be love and mercy.&#160; Thank you for speaking out for life, for marriage and for teaching others about prayer.&#160; I love you and My son (name withheld) and your family very dearly.&#160; Do not fear, but have confidence and trust in My love.&#160; All will be well.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Jesus. Amen!&#160; Alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wixGuard&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;February 17, 2019&#160; Adoration Chapel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Hello, Jesus ever present in the Most Blessed Sacrament.&#160; It is good to be here with You, Lord.&#160; Thank You for Mass and Holy Communion, Jesus.&#160; Thank You for our pastor and for all in our parish family.&#160; Jesus, please reunite all who have left the Faith and all who are separated from the true Faith.&#160; Jesus, please bring all of those who are in my family back to the Church.&#160; Thank You for loving me, Lord.&#160; Thank You for the gift of faith and for everything in my life, Lord.&#160; All good things come from You and Your Holy, Divine Will.&#160; Jesus, please heal (name withheld).&#160; Help him to be able to remain independent.&#160; Please heal (names withheld) and all who are ill.&#160; Thank You for my husband’s good health, Lord.&#160; Praise You and thank You for the many blessings You give us, Your children.&#160; Jesus, please help the priest who is being accused.&#160; Help him, Jesus in his hour of need.&#160; Jesus, heal the one who is victim.&#160; Heal all emotional and spiritual wounds, Lord.&#160; Walk beside the person who is in need and bring Your deep healing love to the heart that is wounded.&#160; Jesus, please protect our holy priests.&#160; Keep them safe from all spiritual, emotional and physical harm.&#160; Please do this also for my children and grandchildren, Lord.&#160; I love You, Jesus.&#160; Help me to love You more.&#160; I trust You, Lord.&#160; Help me to trust You more.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, I love you.&#160; I love you no matter what is going on in your life; no matter how much stress you are experiencing, or how distant you may feel from Me.&#160; I am with you and I will never leave you.&#160; I pursue My children, so much love have I for them.&#160; Do not be concerned about your feelings for they will come and go.&#160; I am at work in spite of them.&#160; Yes, at times I work so deeply that one feels it in their emotions and at other times I work so deeply that it isn’t felt.&#160; What I am saying is that you cannot gauge the level of work I am doing in your soul on your feelings.&#160; Therefore, do not be concerned when you feel distant from Me.&#160; I am not referring to those who feel distant from God because of sin.&#160; That is another matter and one that requires repentance.&#160; I am referring to the ebbs and flows one feels in their emotions due to various external circumstances.&#160; Always refocus your thoughts and prayers on Me. &#160;Think about My life, My birth, My coming into the world.&#160; Think about My life growing up in Nazareth with My Most Holy Mother Mary and St. Joseph.&#160; Think of the years of My teaching and preaching, healing and forgiving.&#160; Think of My betrayal, of the times I stood before My accusers and Herod and Pilate.&#160; Think of My passion, My death and My resurrection.&#160; Meditate on My life and you will begin to feel closer to Me once again.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord!&#160; Jesus, help me to know what to do about this evening.&#160; Please help me to get everything done or if You want me to go to the parish function to fulfill Your Will, let me know that also.&#160; Wherever You prefer I go is fine with me, Lord as long as it is Your Will.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, please heal (names withheld).&#160; Help (name withheld) to get well.&#160; Lord, please protect (names withheld) until You bring them back and into the Church.&#160; Protect them from all spiritual harm, Lord.&#160; Prepare us for our pilgrimage, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little one, entrust everything to Me.&#160; All that is going on in the Church and everything that is going on in the world.&#160; Entrust all to Me.&#160; I am the answer to every problem in life.&#160; Focus on My Kingdom and keeping this alive in your heart.&#160; Do not be concerned about anything else.&#160; Focus on Me.&#160; Bring the love of God to others.&#160; The world is in so much need of My love.&#160; My Mother is with you.&#160; You have noticed the presence of My Mother and your earthly Mother lately.&#160; Your family in Heaven prays for you.&#160; They are nearer than you can imagine.&#160; All is going according to My Will.&#160; I am guiding you even when you are unaware.&#160; The trust you have in Me, the trust of a child, makes you open to My Will and enables you to be led by Me.&#160; In the next week, focus on this, My child; on trusting your Jesus.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Lord.&#160; Thank You, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Do not worry or wonder what this means, My child.&#160; Only trust.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Alright, Jesus, my Lord and my God.&#160; I am not capable of the things You ask of me but I know You always provide, Lord and I trust in You.&#160; There is nothing else for me, Jesus.&#160; You are my all and my everything.&#160; My loved ones are from You.&#160; My material things come from You.&#160; My health, my work, my family—everything is from You.&#160; Thank You, Jesus.&#160; I am grateful.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“And, My little lamb, I am grateful to you.&#160; This is difficult for you to accept, but you are learning to accept it more and more.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, only because You are so good, kind and loving.&#160; You are the perfect gentleman, if I may say so.&#160; Your love knows no end and so out of Your benevolence, You even thank us for loving You which is in itself a gift from You!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My child and yet it is a choice that you are free to make and so I say, thank you for choosing to love Me, the one who is so unloved.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;My Jesus, it is wrong that You are unloved.&#160; You are the essence of love!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My child.&#160; I am the love.&#160; Yet there are so few who love Me.&#160; I am longing for My people to love Me.&#160; I want all souls to be with Me one day in Heaven.&#160; In order for this to occur, people must choose to love Me.&#160; It is that simple.&#160; It comes down to a choice to love.&#160; That is always what it comes down to, My little one.&#160; In every decision, think of love.&#160; This will help you to decide the correct and best path.&#160; Ask Me for clarity and I will help you.&#160; Pray about each decision and I will guide you.&#160; All will be well.&#160; Trust in Me.&#160; Trust in My love for you.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Lord, please give me the grace to love heroically.&#160; Help me to love as You love.&#160; You loved those who betrayed and rejected You.&#160; You are still loving those who do not love You in return.&#160; Help me to love You so much that I only see the good in others, no matter what, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, My child I want all of My children to love their enemies.&#160; There are people in the world and in your nation who are difficult to love.&#160; They do not see the world the way you do.&#160; They do not know the true meaning of love.&#160; Love them.&#160; Pray for them.&#160; Be merciful and kind to them.&#160; Especially when they push you away.&#160; Especially when they do not understand you.&#160; I want My children to show the love of God in everything you do and with everyone you meet, no matter how difficult it seems.&#160; My Holy Spirit, the lover of your soul will help you.&#160; My Mother will help you.&#160; She is the innocent and the pure one.&#160; Her heart is Immaculate and all She knows is love.&#160; One who loves deeply feels more deeply.&#160; She is more sensitive for She is love.&#160; Go to Her and ask Her to teach you in Her school of love.&#160; She will teach and guide you even closer to Me.&#160; And so, My child I know that you must leave soon.&#160; These words must be meditated on.&#160; They do not seem to be very profound or deep to some people, but to those who have fertile soil in their hearts, these words have life.&#160; They come from the living water of life.&#160; If these were the only words I had given you, they would be enough because with love, trust and mercy, you have the Gospel.&#160; It all comes down to love of God and neighbor, trust in Me and in My Divine Will and to trust in My mercy and show mercy to others.&#160; This is the essence of the Gospel, My little lamb.&#160; It is simple enough for small children to understand and difficult enough for the hard hearted to believe.&#160; For those who are considered wise in the world, My words are a contradiction.&#160; To those who have wisdom of Spirit, My words are truth and light.&#160; Go and take this light, the light that is Me, to the world.&#160; You, My Children of Light, you are My little apostles.&#160; You must be carriers of Christ.&#160; You must take Me in your hearts to others and then give Me away.&#160; There is enough of Me for everyone, My children so do not fear.&#160; There is so little time for some souls and you must have a sense of urgency.&#160; Be at peace, but also realize I am counting on you to bring Me to others who do not know Me and do not know the love of God.&#160; If you do not do this; who will?&#160; I love you and I am with you, so you have&#160;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nothing&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;to fear.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Go in peace, My child.&#160; Thank you for your sacrifice last week.&#160; I noticed and I gave you and (names withheld) graces for your sacrifice of love.&#160; The crosses involved seemed great especially for (name withheld).&#160; This causes every more merit, so do not be concerned that you were unable to visit Me here, for you visited Me there and truly gave a gift of love.&#160; I bless you in My Father’s name, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.&#160; Go in peace.&#160; Go in My love.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Amen, Jesus!&#160; Alleluia!&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;February 3, 2019&#160; Adoration Chapel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Hello my Jesus present in the Most Blessed Sacrament.&#160; I love You, praise You, believe in You and adore You, my Lord and my God.&#160; Thank You for Your presence, Jesus.&#160; Thank You for Holy Mass and Communion this morning, Lord.&#160; Jesus, please help the people of Venezuela.&#160; They are suffering from the oppressive government who has crippled their economy.&#160; People are starving, Lord in that once stable and beautiful country.&#160; Please intervene, Lord and help the people.&#160; Restore their democracy and their Constitution.&#160; Give them hope, Jesus; hope in You.&#160; Lord, please heal the sick, especially those with cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s and neurological disorders and renal failure.&#160; Please help (name withheld) to get connected with a physician who can diagnose her illnesses.&#160; Lord, I pray that if it is Your Will, You will heal her through (name withheld).&#160; Be with her husband, too Jesus.&#160; Lord, I have much to be thankful for and I give You the honor and glory for every good thing in my life, especially my friends and family.&#160; Jesus, please bring people who have left the Church home, especially those in my own family.&#160; I pray also for those outside the church that they will be united to God through the One Holy and Apostolic Catholic Church.&#160; Lord, please heal me, also.&#160; Jesus, I trust in You.&#160; Jesus, I trust in You.&#160; Jesus, I trust in You.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, have You anything to say to me?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My child.&#160; There is much to say.&#160; My children must stand for the truth and the truth is Jesus. &#160;I am the Way, the Truth and the Life.&#160; Science points to certain truths, but it rests on Me.&#160; I created the world and science helps mankind to discover laws and the order that points to Me.&#160; Without Me there cannot be science, for without Me, the world would not exist.&#160; Look at the principles of science, My children and the set of assumptions that must exist without which science would not exist.&#160; Science helps man to understand the elements, but it must assume the elements already exist.&#160; Where do the molecules come from if they were not created?&#160; The purpose of science is to discover what I have created and to understand each part of creation in relation to another, but it is not creation.&#160; It is not God.&#160; Science points to creation and to God.&#160; Science is good, My children when used for the purpose of understanding more about creation and the creation.&#160; It is not, however to take the place of the Creator.&#160; Scientists who love and follow Me will have the most efficacy in their work.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child atheism and scientism are rampant in the world.&#160; Do not be afraid to dispute these ism’s for they are antithetical to God and My Kingdom.&#160; Arm your children and grandchildren with the truths of the Faith for future generations but also for this generation so that they may come to believe and teach others.&#160; Atheism and scientism are not difficult to refute, My child, for they are self-refuting, My little one.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Jesus.&#160; Lord, please help us to have words from the Holy Spirit when needed.&#160; It is difficult to know what to say when people refute You.&#160; Give us the power of Your love and the graces to speak with the power of Your Spirit.&#160; Give us wisdom and truth, Lord to appeal to their reason.&#160; These are dark days, Lord but You are the Light of the World.&#160; Bring light once again, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, you are struggling with many burdens.&#160; Do not worry, but trust in Me.”&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus.&#160; I trust in You.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“I am with you and I know what you are going through.&#160; You have many priorities to manage.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus and it seems that I am not doing very well.&#160; I need to rely on You more, Jesus.&#160; Even just one commitment that I have (family) seems to consume time I don’t have with working and classes.&#160; I try not to drop something more important, prayer and time spent with You, Lord.&#160; Jesus, You are the Creator.&#160; You created time.&#160; Help me to manage time more wisely and to make the most of it if there are ways I could do something more efficiently, help me to recognize and make changes.&#160; Sometimes I procrastinate, Jesus because I get so tired of studying constantly.&#160; I’d rather be with My family, Lord.&#160; If I should not be taking these classes, Lord please tell me.&#160; Help me to see clearly what it is You want me to do.&#160; I know that sometimes You want me to do something difficult so that I will rely completely on You.&#160; Is that what I’m doing wrong, Lord?&#160; Not relying completely on You?&#160; Guide me, Lord in what I ought to do.&#160; Keep me in line with Your holy, perfect Will, Jesus.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, My child, you will get through this.&#160; Consider how different this course is from the previous courses.&#160; Are you enjoying the subject matter more?&#160; Did you think you would be taking this class at all?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;You are right, Lord.&#160; I had no idea I would be taking this class.&#160; It wasn’t one I would have chosen and yet I am enjoying it.&#160; Although, I may not say that after the next assignment.&#160; So many secular ideas and errors are being taught in universities.&#160; Our young people are being inundated with false notions and they are presented as facts.&#160; It’s so insidious, Lord.&#160; I don’t know how they can detect it without a firm foundation of truth.&#160; Jesus, please help our young people.&#160; I know we need to do so, but we cannot without You, Lord.&#160; Help us, Jesus.&#160; Equip us with all that is needed to counteract the lies sold to our young people as truth.&#160; Their professors and the textbooks have credibility with them, and many don’t listen to their parents.&#160; Even worse, many parents lack faith, also.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My little lamb.&#160; What you say is true.&#160; Pray much.&#160; Love much.&#160; Be merciful and speak the truth in love.&#160; Thank You for coming to this chapel, My child.&#160; I know your time today is limited.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Oh, Jesus.&#160; You are my Lord and my God.&#160; You are most important in my life above all things.&#160; You are the highest good.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My child and I am always by your side.&#160; I will go with you when you leave this place.&#160; Do not worry.&#160; I am helping you and I will continue to do so.&#160; Bring My light to all you meet.&#160; Have no fear.&#160; I am with you and I do not leave you to face your concerns alone.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Jesus.&#160; I love You, Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“I bless you in the name of My Father, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.&#160; Go in peace and in confidence My little lamb.&#160; Be at ease due to your trust in My mercy.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Jesus!&#160;

Adoration Chapel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Hello my Jesus present in the Blessed Sacrament of the altar.&#160; I adore You and praise You, Lord and I&#160;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;love&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#160;You!&#160; Thank You for the gift of Your life to redeem me.&#160; Thank You for the Sacraments, for Holy Mass.&#160; Thank You for the saints in Heaven who intercede for us, Your people.&#160; Thank You for Our Lady Queen of the saints and Queen of Heaven and Earth, our Mother.&#160; Thank You for every good gift as all come from You.&#160; Lord, You know all who are in my heart.&#160; I bring each one to You and lay them at the foot of Your cross.&#160; I pray especially for those who are ill, Jesus.&#160; Help them, heal them in their every need. &#160;Bring them close to Your Heart, Lord from which love and mercy pour forth on the world.&#160; Bring all who are away from the one true, holy and Apostolic Faith to You, Jesus.&#160; Bring them back to the family of Christ in His Church.&#160; End all division, Lord as only You can do.&#160; Guard, guide and direct Your Church through these treacherous waters and lead us in the way You would have us go, toward Your Heavenly Kingdom.&#160; Help us, Jesus to follow You more closely than ever.&#160; Keep me on Your path, Lord through the help and graces of Your Mother.&#160; Jesus, please give me Your guidance and direction regarding all of my concerns and questions.&#160; You know everything, my Jesus.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, you are struggling with many things but you must give them all to Me and trust Me to work all to My glory and in accordance to My Will.&#160; When you give Me your concerns, I work everything out, so be of good cheer and have a light heart.&#160; I take care of You, my child.&#160; It has always been this way.&#160; Did I not hear your prayers for your friend and My child (name withheld)?&#160; Have I not arranged for My holy priest son to minister to her?&#160; You are aware of My great love and mercy and approach Me with confidence, therefore trust in Me and all that I Will for your friends and family members.&#160; You have spoken about My answer to prayer, and you know this.&#160; I speak of it only to reinforce and confirm this for you.&#160; I speak of it also to remind you to trust in Me and to be joyful knowing I am in control.&#160; I work through My children.&#160; I am working through you, My little one.&#160; Rejoice, My daughter, you have My love and friendship.&#160; Do you realize how much freedom there is in this?&#160; When I was on earth, My friends had more confidence in approaching Me with their needs or the needs of others.&#160; In fact, I counted on them to do so.&#160; People often went directly to My friends to request needs for healing and words of life.&#160; This was not necessary, but it is human nature.&#160; There were many souls who felt more free to approach one of My disciples or My beautiful Mother to communicate their desires first.&#160; This is the way of holy intercession.&#160; You are My friend and people have and will continue to come to you with their burdens or needs.&#160; You bring them to Me, along with your other brothers and sisters.&#160; I gather every request and petition and place them in My Sacred Heart where only love, mercy and goodness resides.&#160; This means, My Will, will be done.&#160; I especially love prayers that rise up from hearts full of love and concern for others.&#160; These are true prayers of the heart.”&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Pray from the heart My children.&#160; Pray from your love of another.&amp;gt; Pray from your needs and desires.&#160; Pray from a genuine and sincere love of God knowing Him as your Father who is benevolent and caring.&#160; Trust, My Children of the Light.&#160; Be holy witnesses to God’s love.&#160; What is needed most in every corner of the world, is love; My love.&#160; My love is the answer to all of the problems in the world.&#160; My mercy springs forth from My love to bind wounds, to heal the broken hearted, to bring peace and joy and to free the oppressed.&#160; The world oppresses, but I make all who call on My Holy Name free.&#160; I liberate captives now just as I did during My earthly ministry.&#160; I heal the wounded and the sick now, just as I did during My earthly ministry.&#160; My power is not diminished because I am no longer alive physically on the earth.&#160; That is a false notion.&#160; Do not listen to anyone who makes this claim.&#160; This is a grave error.&#160; My child, I am pleased with your words today regarding My power.&#160; I am God, and I work through My Church.&#160; I work through all who believe in Me.&#160; I am not limited by anything; not by space, nor time, nor worldly circumstances.&#160; By My own Will, I limit Myself out of love and respect of the individual will.&#160; If one refuses My love, I do not force Myself on them, for that would be unloving to do so.&#160; To force Myself would be to usurp the very dignity that I bestow on humanity.&#160; I cannot be untrue to what I create, because I AM truth itself.&#160; Therefore, I count on you, My Children of the Light, My followers to pray for others, to sacrifice and to minister to those who have cold hearts, and to those in need of love, healing and peace.&#160; Be merciful and minister to your brothers and sisters in need, for this is love.&#160; This is living the Gospel of your Jesus.&#160; I am all love and I call My disciples to pick up your cross and follow Me, the Love.&#160; Reflect on this.&#160; Meditate on the cross and what it means to follow Me on the path of love.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child I am working in the hearts of your family members.&#160; I am working in the lives of those for whom you pray.&#160; I am working in your life, even when you are unaware.&#160; Rejoice and be glad.&#160; I take care of everything.&#160; Thank you for following the divine prompts I send you.&#160; Your heart is more open to My Spirit and you are acting upon these prompts!&#160; To do so is to love and to trust.&#160; You are growing in this, My child.&#160; I know you do not think so, for you focus on your deficiencies.&#160; I focus on your acts of faith and love.&#160; You are not perfect, I know.&#160; You are being perfected in My Heart.&#160; Sometimes progress is slow and sometimes it is fast.&#160; It is on My timetable.&#160; I bring you through trials to increase your trust in Me.&#160; I bring you through trials to have an offering, My child.&#160; Even the burdens you carry out of love for others are a cross offered to Me for souls.&#160; I will take any act of love, My child.&#160; Any act, even a burden carried from love, and use the graces that you have cooperated with to bring light, love, mercy and healing.&#160; My children pray, learn, and act in the world.&#160; You move about filled with graces from the Sacraments and from My Holy Mother and you take these into the world.&#160; The world cannot help but be changed by My grace working in and through My children of love.&#160; The whole world will change one day when I pour out My Spirit and the Triumph of My Mother’s Immaculate Heart occurs.&#160; In the meantime, prepare for Her Triumph by doing your part to bring My love to others.&#160; This time, this Age of Disobedience will, through My love, become the Age of Obedience to My Will.&#160; You are living now at the threshold of this time.&#160; Be bold in your acts of gentle love.&#160; Be bold in your witness to the truth.&#160; Be bold and confident and always gentle with souls in need for they are fragile and only I know what they are going through.&#160; Therefore, you must rely on your Jesus to guide you.&#160; I care for each and every person, My child, for all are My children.&#160; Therefore, love them as I love them.&#160; Pray for them as I pray for them to Our Father in Heaven.&#160; Be merciful as I am merciful.&#160; Through My love and mercy, the world will change and My Mother’s Heart will triumph.&#160; There is no heart created by God who loves Me more than My Mother loves Me.&#160; She gives graces from Her Immaculate Heart, the heart of love, the heart that nurtured the Son of God and it is from this heart, the Immaculate Heart, that My flame of love will be ignited and spread through the entire world, just as fire spreads rapidly when conditions are dry, so will the flame of love spread.&#160; There is much dryness in this dark world, but take heart knowing that dryness can be ignited in leaves and kindling by a very small spark which spreads rapidly through forests and burns in a devastating way, just as the fires in California, My child.&#160; Only, My flame purifies.&#160; My flame sets dry, cold hearts on fire with My holy love.&#160; The flame of love is My Mother’s perfect love for Me.&#160; Man loves imperfectly but My Mother loved with perfection.&#160; This love from Her heart will spread like fire and the Holy Spirit, the love will fan the flames until the entire earth burns brightly with the love of God.&#160; This, My little lamb will be the Renewal.&#160; You will know, My child when you are in the time of the Renewal, as will all people alive on earth and alive in Heaven.&#160; It will be a time of deep love and unity with God and all things will be new in the light and love of God.&#160; So, take heart during your trials and take this opportunity to offer them freely and with joy (each and every trial and burden) no matter how small or how large. &#160;Offer all for your Jesus to save souls.&#160; This then becomes the living sacrifice and a beautiful offering for God.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, I am with you and I will never leave you to face your trials alone.&#160; When you feel alone, I am even closer to you.&#160; Be encouraged and remember this.&#160; I love you.&#160; All will be well.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord.&#160; I love You!&#160; Thank You for Holy Mass today.&#160; Thank You for our beautiful visit with (names withheld) yesterday.&#160; Thank You for all You are doing in our family and with our friends.&#160; Be with those who are dying, Lord wherever they are and console them.&#160; Put their heads on Your Sacred Heart and infuse Your love into their souls so they will cease to be afraid.&#160; Carry them in Your arms, sweet Jesus.&#160; I love You!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“And I love you, My child.&#160; I am with you.&#160; All will be well.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Amen!&#160;

I pray also for those who do not know Your love and for those who are away from the Church.&#160; For all our priests and religious, remain ever beside them Jesus and help them with graces for Heaven, Lord.&#160; Keep them safe and protect them from all physical harm.&#160; Thank You for all that You are doing for us, Lord.&#160; Jesus, please also help (name withheld).&#160; He is exhausted from all the snow removal and trying to study, Lord.&#160; Help him to get some sleep and also to cover all that he needs for school.&#160; Lord, bless all who are going to Washington for the Walk for Life.&#160; Help our youth to carry the torch for the Gospel, Jesus.&#160; Please help us to have conversion and come to see the truth, Jesus.&#160; You are truth, Jesus.&#160; Make blind eyes see, Lord so they will know You are God of all the living.&#160; Praise You, Lord God King of Heaven and Earth.&#160;

They are lonely and deprived of My love and the life of the Spirit but I will blow the powerful breath of life and the Spirit will come upon them.&#160; Many will follow Me and do great things for God.&#160;

I love all of My children, and I especially care for the children of My closest friends.&#160; Do you not care about your friends’ children and loved ones?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Lord.&#160; Of course!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My child and all of My children are beloved children.&#160; Who loves more than the Love?”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;No one does, Jesus.&#160; It is impossible to love more than You.&#160; You created us out of love.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, and so entrust the souls of those you love to Me.&#160; Love them enough to let go of them and give them to your Jesus, who is all love.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Jesus.&#160; I love You.&#160; Help me to love You even more.&#160; Glory and praise to You, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little one, if your loved ones, friends and family members do not come to love Me now, they will when the changes come for they will be faced with many sobering truths.&#160; If they do not find Me then, they will during the Illumination of Consciences.&#160; At some point, the lost ones who have had so many tears shed for them and so much love poured out for them in prayer will open their hearts to the love of God.&#160; Continue to pray for them and be at peace.&#160; Love them.&#160; Speak less and love and pray more.&#160; Love wins souls for your Jesus.&#160; Be at peace.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Yes, Jesus.&#160; Lord, open the hearts of those who are suffering from depression.&#160; Heal them, Jesus.&#160; Remove their fears and anxieties.&#160; Give them Your peace, Lord that only You can give.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Many suffer from this in such a dark time in the world.&#160; Souls suffer because of the darkness around them and it can be difficult for them to see the Light of Christ.&#160; This is especially true for souls who have a high degree of sensitivity.&#160; Pray for them, offer sacrifices (penance) and have Masses said for them.&#160; Ask My Mother to be with them and to intercede for them.&#160; My Mother’s presence chases all shadows away in every darkened corner.&#160; She brings the light of My love.&#160; Remember this My children.&#160; Pray more and rejoice that you have so many saints in Heaven and the Queen of Heaven praying for you.&#160; Do not forget to ask for their intercession. Their prayers are needed especially so in this day.&#160; The reason there are so many problems and so much sin is because there are not enough people praying.&#160; Those of you who know the times and the seriousness of these days—pray more.&#160; You must pray more for there are so few prayers, even from those who know and love Me.&#160; You spend much time on things that are fleeting and unimportant because you do not have enough love in your hearts for the plight of My poor children who are in need of your prayers.&#160; You think much in these days of your own comfort and pleasure when you could deny yourselves more and pray.&#160; Think of acts of kindness you can do for others.&#160; Be faithful to your vocations, My children.&#160; Fathers, love your children and your wives.&#160; Pay attention to them.&#160; Serve and provide and live the faith that I died to give you.&#160; Wives, love your husbands.&#160; Care for them and for your children.&#160; Be holy examples of love.&#160; Teach your children to love and respect their fathers.&#160; Show respect for your husbands and the children will follow your example.&#160; Husbands and wives, you have a mission from God for your marriage.&#160; Be open to Me and to My Will.&#160; Live lives of love and sacrifice for one another.&#160; I bless you with many material things so you can share them with others.&#160; I bless you with love to give love abundantly to your children and to those around you as well as those who are in need.&#160; Be love to all you meet.&#160; Put your children as a high priority and in this way, you will focus your attention on raising them in a balanced, disciplined and loving manner.&#160; Teach your children to respect you and to respect God, but first show them with your love.&#160; They must learn from you that they are good and worthy of your love or they will not be as open to My love.&#160; This is a major problem in the world, My children.&#160; Many young children do not have loving, faithful earthly fathers.&#160; If children grow up with fathers who are not present in their homes, who they see only on occasion and when they are together, there is no time spent talking and being present to one another, how can they come to know and trust in God the Father?&#160; It is difficult, My children.&#160; I made you in My image and likeness and I gave families to the world to be models of the Holy Family and point the way to the love of the Blessed Trinity.&#160; Renew your vows of marriage and renew the love that you had in the beginning.&#160; The world is starving for love and they (My children) have not experienced real love in the heart of the family where it all begins.&#160; Pray for holy marriages.&#160; Work for holy marriages.&#160; Be present to one another.&#160; You are the most important part of God’s plan for children. (Husbands and wives) Without holy children who grow in God’s love, the world has become and will continue to be steeped in darkness and sin.”&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Jesus, there are some holy people who want to be married but have not found the right godly person.&#160; Please help them, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“Yes, My child.&#160; There are not as many holy young people for them because their parents (of the ones who are not living for God) did not raise them to know and love Me.&#160; Even those parents who did so had an uphill battle because of the culture and the impact of so many living lives void of God.&#160; Still, persevere in your faithfulness.&#160; Trust in Me, My children who love and serve Me.&#160; Pray and do God’s Will and if it is your vocation to be married (by your discernment and your choice) I will provide a holy person to be your spouse.&#160; Do not be afraid.&#160; Live for your Jesus, and all will be well.&#160; Be joyful in your love for Me.&#160; Trust Me and be at peace.&#160; I will provide all that is good for My children, but trust in Me to provide.&#160; This is important.&#160; When one takes matters into one’s own hands, rather than waiting upon the Lord, that is&#160;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;not&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;trust.&#160; Trust in Me and in My ways and you will not be disappointed.&#160; I love you and I want the good for Mine.&#160; I want to build holy families.&#160; Wait upon Me, the Lord for all that you need and I will provide.&#160; My child, you are concerned for (name withheld), I understand.&#160; Remember how far he has come.&#160; I will not abandon him.&#160; I will help him to carry his load. He is learning to trust Me and to abandon all to Me.&#160; This is good.&#160; Be patient and trust.&#160; I love you, My child.&#160; I love each one of My children.&#160; I desire Heaven for every one I have created.&#160; Walk the road I have given you.&#160; You do not walk alone.&#160; Take solace in this, My children.&#160; I am coming into the world.&#160; Prepare your hearts and create an environment of love, peace and mercy wherever you go to help Me prepare the hearts of others.&#160; Pray for the renewal and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit again on the world.&#160; Pray as the people of old prayed for the coming of the Messiah.&#160; Your prayers, your holiness, your love will usher in the new times.&#160; Be busy about building the Father’s Kingdom so that when I come again I will find much faith on the earth.&#160; On this Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, pray for the Holy Spirit to renew your hearts and the hearts of all in the world.&#160; I am the water of life.&#160; Come to Me and I will quench your thirst.&#160; I love You!&#160; You may go in My peace.&#160; I bless you in the name of My Father, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.&#160; Go in My peace, in My love and with My mercy.&#160; And, dearest children, pray, pray, pray.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord Jesus.&#160;

You are so beautiful here, Lord.&#160; You are small and vulnerable, just as You were in the manger when You came as a baby to us in Bethlehem.&#160; Here You are hidden in a small piece of bread that was transformed (transubstantiated) into our living God.&#160; Praise You, Jesus my God and my King.&#160; Lord, many did not accept You then, and many do not now.&#160; Lord, I ask You to melt hardened hearts, heal their wounds and give souls the graces needed to seek and find You, Lord.&#160; May many souls come to You during this new year and throughout 2019, Jesus like the shepherds and the magi.&#160; Bring home lost souls, Lord.&#160; Jesus, give us grace to evangelize, to bring Your love to our brothers and sisters who do not know Your love.&#160; Bless our Church, Jesus.&#160; May this year bring about our purification so we become holy and return to Your loving embrace.&#160; Jesus, we long for You.&#160; Our world needs Your peace, oh Prince of Peace.&#160; Save us from ourselves, Lord.&#160; Little infant, Jesus save us.&#160; Glory to God in the highest and peace to His people on earth.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My child, it is good that you are here with Me.&#160; Your presence and the presence of My other children console Me.&#160; I give you My peace and My assurance that I will be with you always.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Lord.&#160; Jesus, please help (name withheld). &#160;Cure her, Lord.&#160; Give her complete faith and trust in You.&#160; Heal her and dissolve the tumor.&#160; Jesus, she just recently returned to Your Church.&#160; Help her to receive sacramental graces and restore her health, mind, body and spirit, Lord.&#160; She loves You, Jesus.&#160; I ask for healing also for (name withheld).&#160; Please, Jesus I am sure she is helping You in Your work to bring many souls to conversion through her sufferings and prayers.&#160; I just pray that You sustain her and in Your timing to heal her.&#160; She is our friend, Jesus.&#160; I know Your Will is always perfect, but please may it be Your Will to heal her.&#160; Lord, thank You for another year with (name withheld).&#160; Thank You for his special birthday and for the beautiful Mass at the Cathedral and the opportunity to venerate the relic of St. John Vianney whose heart loved You dearly.&#160; St. John, please pray that the Lord will increase His love in our hearts.&#160; May it grow from a small flame to a forest fire, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, this is a good prayer.&#160; My love will grow in all hearts who seek Me and ask for My love.&#160; This is what I want for you and for each of My children.&#160; I want all of My Children of Light to remain steadfast in their love for Me.&#160; Do not be like those who are in love with the idea of love, but unwilling to put others first, but instead be like My holy saints who thought first of God, then neighbor and then of themselves.&#160; When God is your first love, there is nothing you won’t do for Him.&#160; You will forget yourself and focus on the love.&#160; Then, you will find it easy to love your neighbor because your hearts will be full of the love of God.&#160; When love is disordered and out of place, many wounds are made to the soul.&#160; Self-love becomes the first priority and love of neighbor and God last.&#160; Perhaps non-existent even.&#160; The proper order is God first, then all things fall into place, in holy order.&#160; When God is loved first above all other things (and I say ‘things’ intentionally) you will be able to see clearly and prioritize all that is in your lives.&#160; Family will be in proper order, work, home life, helping your neighbors and those in need, etc.&#160; Only in ordered love will you find peace.&#160; With those who do not put God first, there is no peace.&#160; There is internal struggle and conflict and even external struggles.&#160; The opposite of order is disorder.&#160; Disorder causes other problems and can even be the root cause of severe stress and strain and loss of health, dis-ease.&#160; I do not mean to say that disordered love is the reason for all disease and illness.&#160; That is not what I mean.&#160; I am saying that it can cause other problems, the worst of which are spiritual in nature.&#160; Put God and the love of God first in your hearts and in your lives.&#160; To put God first in your lives means you love God with your whole heart and you live out this love for Me in all that you do.&#160; You show My love to others.&#160; You look beyond petty annoyances and see the heart of the other.&#160; To see the heart of another and if they are wounded, you will have mercy on them and see with the eyes of love what may not be evident to your physical eyes.&#160; See people as I see them, as sons and daughters of God; perhaps lost, perhaps wounded, perhaps ill from lack of love, but always as My children, whom I loved and whom I died to set free from sin.&#160; Love as I love, My children.&#160; Be kind as I am kind.&#160; Be patient as I am patient.&#160; My children always want Me to treat you with mercy and tenderness but often you do not wish this for others who have hurt you in some way.&#160; For those people you would like them to grovel at your feet for mercy and forgiveness and if they do not, you would prefer that I punish them severely for what they have done to you, no matter how small the offense.&#160; For you personally, you want only kindness and mercy from Me for the most egregious sins.&#160; My children, admit this is true, for I know your hearts.&#160; Better to admit this and seek forgiveness than to lie to yourselves and die in sin.&#160; What I desire all of you have—is mercy.&#160; Be merciful as I am merciful.&#160; Love as I love.&#160; Treat others with the same kindness, love and forgiveness as I give to you.&#160; You must pick up your cross and follow Me.&#160; You must die to yourselves, to all self-centeredness and live for Me, your Jesus.&#160; This is the way to walk in My footsteps.&#160; This is the way to Heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You my Lord Jesus!&#160; Praise You, Lord!&#160; Jesus, please be with each soul who is dying today.&#160; Take them to Your heavenly kingdom, where You live and reign.&#160; Heal broken families, Jesus where lessons of love are taught to the little domestic church.&#160; Heal marriages, Jesus as only You can do.&#160; Bring about the long-awaited renewal, Lord.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little lamb, it is good to pray in this manner.&#160; Continue to pray for My Mother’s reign, when her Immaculate Heart will triumph.&#160; Pray for souls to convert.&#160; Fast and pray for loved ones who are in need.&#160; I love you, My children and remember, all people are My children.&#160; Allow Me to love you and then you give My love to all you meet and all you encounter.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Thank You, Jesus, my Lord and Savior.&#160; I love You.&#160; Help me to love You more.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“My little one, just as I supplied My Apostles with all that was needed to witness to the love, so shall I do for you.&#160; I will provide what is needed for all of My children who love and follow Me with sincere hearts.&#160; Do not worry about what you are to say to others when you give My love.&#160; Neither be concerned with what they need for only I know what a heart needs.&#160; I will provide.&#160; Trust in Me and all will be well.&#160; Go in My peace, My little lamb.&#160; I thank you.&#160; You provide much consolation to your Jesus with your companionship.&#160; We are friends and I love you dearly.&#160; I bless you in the name of My Father, in My name and in the name of My Holy Spirit.&#160; Go in My peace and in My love.&#160; Trust in Me.&#160; All will be well.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Amen!&#160; Alleluia!&#160; I love You my Lord and my God.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;“And I love you.”&lt;/p&gt;"}]
